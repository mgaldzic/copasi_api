  \brief   Ssimulator that performs a multi-cell stochastic simulation using 
			a variant of the Gillespie algorithm. 
	
	The algorithm has two levels of events (or reactions):
	
	Level 1: Cell birth and death
	Level 2: reactions inside each cell
	
	An overview of the algorithm:
	
		current time: t0
		Calculate next time for cell birth or cell death: t1
	    Calculate probability of cell death and event
		
		select an event: cell birth or cell death
		
		update cell count
		
		from t0 until t1:
		    for each cell:
			    initialize concentrations for that cell
				do Gillespie simulation
				store final concentrations for that cell
				
	
	Output: all values are aligned to a grid.
