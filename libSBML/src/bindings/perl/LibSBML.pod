=head2 SBMLReader

Methods for reading SBML from files and text strings.
@htmlinclude not-sbml-warning.html
The SBMLReader class provides the main interface for reading SBML
content from files and strings.  The methods for reading SBML all return
an SBMLDocument object representing the results.
In the case of failures (such as if the SBML contains errors or a file
cannot be read), the errors will be recorded with the SBMLErrorLog
object kept in the SBMLDocument returned by SBMLReader.  Consequently,
immediately after calling a method on SBMLReader, callers should always
check for errors and warnings using the methods for this purpose
provided by SBMLDocument.
For convenience as well as easy access from other languages besides C++,
this file also defines two global functions, readSBMLFromFile() and
readSBMLFromString().  They are equivalent to creating an SBMLReader
object and then calling
the @if clike SBMLReader::readSBML() @endif@if java SBMLReader::readSBML(String filename) @endif or
@if clike SBMLReader::readSBMLFromString() @endif@if java SBMLReader::readSBMLFromString(String xml)  @endif methods, respectively.
LibSBML also provides support for reading and writing compressed files
and data streams.  It does this automatically and transparently if
libSBML was configured and compiled with the compression support
enabled.  If the given filename ends with the suffix C<">.gz" (for
example, C<"myfile>.xml.gz"), then the file is assumed to be compressed
in I<gzip> format and will be automatically decompressed upon reading.
Similarly, if the given filename ends with C<">.zip" or C<">.bz2", the
file is assumed to be compressed in I<zip> or I<bzip2> format
(respectively).  Files whose names lack these suffixes will be read
uncompressed.

Applications may sometimes need to query whether the copy of the libSBML
library that they're linked against does support reading and writing
compressed files.  SBMLReader provides the methods hasZlib() and
hasBzip2() and for this purpose.

=item SBMLReader::SBMLReader

Creates a new SBMLReader and returns it. 


=item SBMLReader::readSBML

Reads an SBML document from a file.
If the file named C<filename> does not exist or its content is not
valid SBML, one or more errors will be logged with the SBMLDocument
object returned by this method.  Callers can use the methods on
SBMLDocument such as SBMLDocument::getNumErrors() and
@if clike SBMLDocument::getError() @endif@if java SBMLDocument::getError(long n) @endif to get the errors.  The object returned by
@if clike SBMLDocument::getError() @endif@if java SBMLDocument::getError(long n) @endif is an SBMLError object, and it has methods to
get the error code, category, and severity level of the problem, as
well as a textual description of the problem.  The possible severity
levels range from informational messages to fatal errors; see the
documentation for SBMLError for more information.
If the file C<filename> could not be read, the file-reading error will
appear first.  The error code (a value drawn from the enumeration
#XMLErrorCode_t) can provide a clue about what happened.  For example,
a file might be unreadable (either because it does not actually exist
or because the user does not have the necessary access priviledges to
read it) or some sort of file operation error may have been reported
by the underlying operating system.  Callers can check for these
situations using a program fragment such as the following:
C<ode>
SBMLReader  reader = new SBMLReader();
SBMLDocument  doc  = reader.readSBML(filename);
if (doc->getNumErrors() E<gt> 0)
{
if (doc->getError(0)->getId() == XMLError::FileUnreadable)
{
// Handle case of unreadable file here.
} 
else if (doc->getError(0)->getId() == XMLError::FileOperationError)
{
// Handle case of other file error here.
}
else
{
// Handle other cases -- see error codes defined in XMLErrorCode_t
// for other possible cases to check.
}
}
@endcode

If the given filename ends with the suffix C<">.gz" (for example, @c
"myfile.xml.gz"), the file is assumed to be compressed in I<gzip>
format and will be automatically decompressed upon reading.
Similarly, if the given filename ends with C<">.zip" or C<">.bz2", the
file is assumed to be compressed in I<zip> or I<bzip2> format
(respectively).  Files whose names lack these suffixes will be read
uncompressed.  Note that if the file is in I<zip> format but the
archive contains more than one file, only the first file in the
archive will be read and the rest ignored.
@param filename the name or full pathname of the file to be read.
Returns a pointer to the SBMLDocument created from the SBML content.
@see SBMLError
@note LibSBML versions 2.x and later versions behave differently in
error handling in several respects.  One difference is how early some
errors are caught and whether libSBML continues processing a file in
the face of some early errors.  In general, libSBML versions after 2.x
stop parsing SBML inputs sooner than libSBML version 2.x in the face
of XML errors, because the errors may invalidate any further SBML
content.  For example, a missing XML declaration at the beginning of
the file was ignored by libSBML 2.x but in version 3.x and later, it
will cause libSBML to stop parsing the rest of the input altogether.
While this behavior may seem more severe and intolerant, it was
necessary in order to provide uniform behavior regardless of which
underlying XML parser (Expat, Xerces, libxml2) is being used by
libSBML.  The XML parsers themselves behave differently in their error
reporting, and sometimes libSBML has to resort to the lowest common
denominator.
<br><br>
@note To read a gzip/zip file, libSBML needs to be configured and
linked with the <a href="http://www.zlib.net/">zlib</a> library at
compile time.  It also needs to be linked with the <a
href="">bzip2</a> library to read files in I<bzip2> format.  (Both of
these are the default configurations for libSBML.)  Errors about
unreadable files will be logged if a compressed filename is given and

=item SBMLReader::readSBMLFromFile

Reads an SBML document from a file.
If the file named C<filename> does not exist or its content is not

SBMLDocument such as SBMLDocument::getNumErrors() and

=item SBMLReader::readSBMLFromString

Reads an SBML document from the given XML string.
This method is flexible with respect to the presence of an XML
declaration at the beginning of the string.  In particular, if the
string in C<xml> does not begin with the XML declaration
C<&lt;?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'?&gt;>, then this
method will automatically prepend the declaration to C<xml>.
This method will log a fatal error if the content given in the
parameter C<xml> is not SBML.  See the method documentation for
@if clike SBMLReader::readSBML() @endif@if java SBMLReader::readSBML(String filename) @endif for an example of code for testing the returned
error code.
@param xml a string containing a full SBML model

@htmlinclude not-sbml-warning.html
The SBMLWriter class is the converse of SBMLReader, and provides the
main interface for serializing SBML models into XML and writing the
result to files and text strings.  The methods for writing SBML all take
an SBMLDocument object and a destination.  They return a boolean value
to indicate success or failure.

=item SBMLWriter::SBMLWriter

Creates a new SBMLWriter.


=item SBMLWriter::setProgramName

Sets the name of this program, i.e., the program that is about to
write out the SBMLDocument.
If the program name and version are set (setProgramVersion()), the
following XML comment, intended for human consumption, will be written
at the beginning of the document:

=item SBMLWriter::writeSBML

Writes the given SBML document to filename.
If the given filename ends with the suffix C<">.gz" (for example, @c
"myfile.xml.gz"), libSBML assumes the caller wants the file to be
written compressed in I<gzip>.  Similarly, if the given filename ends
with C<">.zip" or C<">.bz2", libSBML assumes the caller wants the file
to be compressed in I<zip> or I<bzip2> format (respectively).  Files
whose names lack these suffixes will be written uncompressed.
<em>Special considerations for the zip format</em>: If the given
filename ends with C<">.zip", the file placed in the zip archive will
have the suffix C<">.xml" or C<">.sbml".  For example, the file in
the zip archive will be named C<"test>.xml" if the given filename is
C<"test>.xml.zip" or C<"test>.zip".  Similarly, the filename in the
archive will be C<"test>.sbml" if the given filename is @c
"test.sbml.zip".

@note To write a gzip/zip file, libSBML needs to be configured and
linked with the <a href="http://www.zlib.net/">zlib</a> library at
compile time.  It also needs to be linked with the <a

if a compressed filename is given and libSBML was I<not> linked with
the corresponding required library.
@note SBMLReader::hasZlib() and SBMLReader::hasBzip2() can be used to
check whether libSBML has been linked with each library.
@param d the SBML document to be written
@param filename the name or full pathname of the file where the SBML
is to be written. 
Returns C<true> on success and C<false> if the filename could not be
opened for writing.


=item SBMLWriter::writeSBML

Writes the given SBML document to the output stream.
@param d the SBML document to be written
@param stream the stream object where the SBML is to be written.
Returns C<true> on success and C<false> if one of the underlying
parser components fail (rare).


=item SBMLWriter::writeToString

Writes the given SBML document to an in-memory string and returns a
pointer to it.
The string is owned by the caller and should be freed (with C<free>())
when no longer needed.
@param d the SBML document to be written
Returns the string on success and C<0> if one of the underlying parser
components fail.
@deprecated libSBML internal


=item SBMLWriter::writeSBMLToFile

Writes the given SBML document to filename.
If the given filename ends with the suffix C<">.gz" (for example, @c
"myfile.xml.gz"), libSBML assumes the caller wants the file to be
written compressed in I<gzip>.  Similarly, if the given filename ends
with C<">.zip" or C<">.bz2", libSBML assumes the caller wants the file
to be compressed in I<zip> or I<bzip2> format (respectively).  Files
whose names lack these suffixes will be written uncompressed.
<em>Special considerations for the zip format</em>: If the given
filename ends with C<">.zip", the file placed in the zip archive will
have the suffix C<">.xml" or C<">.sbml".  For example, the file in
the zip archive will be named C<"test>.xml" if the given filename is
C<"test>.xml.zip" or C<"test>.zip".  Similarly, the filename in the
archive will be C<"test>.sbml" if the given filename is @c
"test.sbml.zip".

=head2 SBase

LibSBML implementation of SBase, the base class of most SBML objects.
Most components in SBML are derived from a single abstract base type,
SBase.  In addition to serving as the parent class for most other
classes of objects in SBML, this base type is designed to allow a
modeler or a software package to attach arbitrary information to each
major element or list in an SBML model.
SBase has an optional subelement called "notes".  It is intended to
serve as a place for storing optional information intended to be seen by
humans.  An example use of the "notes" element would be to contain
formatted user comments about the model element in which the "notes"
element is enclosed.  There are certain conditions on the XHTML content
permitted inside the "notes" element; please consult the <a
target="_blank" href="http://sbml.org/Documents/Specifications">SBML
specification document</a> corresponding to the SBML Level and Version
of your model for more information about the requirements for "notes"
content.

SBase has another optional subelement called "annotation".  Whereas the
"notes" element described above is a container for content to be shown
directly to humans, the "annotation" element is a container for optional
software-generated content I<not> meant to be shown to humans.  The
element's content type is <a target="_blank"
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-xml-20040204/#elemdecls">XML type
"any"</a>, allowing essentially arbitrary data content.  SBML places
only a few restrictions on the organization of the content; these are
intended to help software tools read and write the data as well as help
reduce conflicts between annotations added by different tools.  As is
the case with "notes", it is important to refer to the <a
target="_blank" href="http://sbml.org/Documents/Specifications">SBML
specification document</a> corresponding to the SBML Level and Version
of your model for more information about the requirements for
"annotation" content.
It is worth pointing out that the "annotation" element in the definition
of SBase exists in order that software developers may attach optional
application-specific data to the elements in an SBML model.  However, it
is important that this facility not be misused.  In particular, it is
<em>critical</em> that data essential to a model definition or that can
be encoded in existing SBML elements is <em>not</em> stored in
"annotation". Parameter values, functional dependencies between model
elements, etc., should not be recorded as annotations.  It is crucial to
keep in mind the fact that data placed in annotations can be freely
ignored by software applications.  If such data affects the
interpretation of a model, then software interoperability is greatly
impeded.

SBML Level 2 introduced an optional SBase attribute named "metaid" for
supporting metadata annotations using RDF (<a target="_blank"
href="http://www.w3.org/RDF/">Resource Description Format</a>). The
attribute value has the data type <a
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml/#id">XML ID</a>, the XML identifier
type, which means each "metaid" value must be globally unique within an
SBML file.  (Importantly, this uniqueness criterion applies across any
attribute with type <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml/#id">XML
ID</a>, not just the "metaid" attribute used by SBML&mdash;something to
be aware of if your application-specific XML content inside the
"annotation" subelement happens to use <a
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml/#id">XML ID</a>.)  The "metaid" value
serves to identify a model component for purposes such as referencing
that component from metadata placed within "annotation" subelements.
Beginning with SBML Level 2 Version 3, SBase also has an optional
attribute named "sboTerm" for supporting the use of the Systems Biology
Ontology.  In SBML proper, the data type of the attribute is a string of
the form "SBO:NNNNNNN", where "NNNNNNN" is a seven digit integer number;
libSBML simplifies the representation by only storing the NNNNNNN
integer portion.  Thus, in libSBML, the "sboTerm" attribute on SBase has
data type C<int>, and SBO identifiers are stored simply as integers.
(For convenience, SBase offers methods for returning both the integer
form and a text-string form of the SBO identifier.)  SBO terms are a
type of optional annotation, and each different class of SBML object
derived from SBase imposes its own requirements about the values
permitted for "sboTerm".  Please consult the SBML Level&nbsp;2
Version&nbsp;4 specification for more information about the use of SBO
and the "sboTerm" attribute.
Finally, note that, in the list of methods on SBase, there is no public
constructor because SBase is an abstract class.  The constructors reside
in the subclasses derived from SBase.
@section sbase-miriam Standard format for annotations linking data resources
SBML Level 2 Versions 2, 3 and 4 define a proposed regular format for
encoding two particular categories of annotations: (a) references to
controlled vocabulary terms and database identifiers which define and
describe biological and biochemical entities in a model; and (b)
descriptions of the provenance of a model, including its author(s) and
modification history.

derived directly or indirectly from type SBase can have a separate
value for "notes", allowing users considerable freedom when adding
comments to their models.
The format of "notes" elements must be <a target="_blank"

=item SBase::getSBMLDocument

Returns the SBMLDocument object containing I<this> object instance.
LibSBML uses the class SBMLDocument as a top-level container for
storing SBML content and data associated with it (such as warnings and

SBMLDocument object.  SBMLDocument corresponds roughly to the class
<i>SBML</i> defined in the SBML Level&nbsp;3 and Level&nbsp;2
specifications, but it does not have a direct correspondence in SBML
Level&nbsp;1.  (But, it is created by libSBML no matter whether the
model is Level&nbsp;1, Level&nbsp;2 or Level&nbsp;3.)

=item SBase::getAncestorOfType

Returns the ancestor SBML object that corresponds to the given
#SBMLTypeCode_t value.
This function allows any object to determine its exact
location/function within a model.  For example, in SBML Level&nbsp;2 a
StoichiometryMath object has ancestors (in order) of type
SpeciesReference, ListOfSpeciesReferences, Reaction, ListOfReactions
and Model, any of which can be accessed via this function.
@param type the #SBMLTypeCode_t of the ancestor being sought.
Returns the ancestor SBML object of this SBML object that corresponds
to the given #SBMLTypeCode_t, or C<NULL> if none exists.


=item SBase::getSBOTerm

Returns the integer portion of the value of the "sboTerm" attribute of
this object.
Beginning with SBML Level 2 Version 3, objects derived from SBase have
an optional attribute named "sboTerm" for supporting the use of the
Systems Biology Ontology.  In SBML proper, the data type of the
attribute is a string of the form "SBO:NNNNNNN", where "NNNNNNN" is a
seven digit integer number; libSBML simplifies the representation by
only storing the NNNNNNN integer portion.  Thus, in libSBML, the
"sboTerm" attribute on SBase has data type C<int>, and SBO identifiers
are stored simply as integers.  (For convenience, libSBML offers
methods for returning both the integer form and a text-string form of
the SBO identifier.)
SBO terms are a type of optional annotation, and each different class
of SBML object derived from SBase imposes its own requirements about
the values permitted for "sboTerm".  Please consult the SBML
Level&nbsp;2 Version&nbsp;4 specification for more information about
the use of SBO and the "sboTerm" attribute.
Returns the value of the "sboTerm" attribute as an integer, or C<-1>
if the value is not set.


=item SBase::getSBOTermID

Returns the string representation of the "sboTerm" attribute of
this object.
Beginning with SBML Level 2 Version 3, objects derived from SBase have
an optional attribute named "sboTerm" for supporting the use of the
Systems Biology Ontology.  In SBML proper, the data type of the
attribute is a string of the form "SBO:NNNNNNN", where "NNNNNNN" is a

only storing the NNNNNNN integer portion.  Thus, in libSBML, the
"sboTerm" attribute on SBase has data type C<int>, and SBO identifiers
are stored simply as integers.  This method returns the entire SBO
identifier as a text string in the form "SBO:NNNNNNN".
SBO terms are a type of optional annotation, and each different class
of SBML object derived from SBase imposes its own requirements about
the values permitted for "sboTerm".  Please consult the SBML

the use of SBO and the "sboTerm" attribute.
Returns the value of the "sboTerm" attribute as a string (its value
will be of the form C<SBO:NNNNNNN>), or an empty string if
the value is not set.


=item SBase::getLine

Returns the line number on which this object first appears in the XML
representation of the SBML document.
Returns the line number of this SBML object.
@see getColumn()
@note The line number for each construct in an SBML model is set upon
reading the model.  The accuracy of the line number depends on the
correctness of the XML representation of the model, and on the
particular XML parser library being used.  The former limitation
relates to the following problem: if the model is actually invalid
XML, then the parser may not be able to interpret the data correctly
and consequently may not be able to establish the real line number.
The latter limitation is simply that different parsers seem to have
their own accuracy limitations, and out of all the parsers supported
by libSBML, none have been 100% accurate in all situations. (At this

=item SBase::setAnnotation

Sets the value of the "annotation" subelement of this SBML object.
The content of C<annotation> is copied, and any previous content of
this object's "annotation" subelement is deleted.
Whereas the SBase "notes" subelement is a container for content to be
shown directly to humans, the "annotation" element is a container for
optional software-generated content I<not> meant to be shown to
humans.  Every object derived from SBase can have its own value for
"annotation".  The element's content type is <a target="_blank"

SBML places a few restrictions on the organization of the content of
annotations; these are intended to help software tools read and write
the data as well as help reduce conflicts between annotations added by
different tools.  Please see the SBML specifications for more details.
Call this method will result in any existing content of the
"annotation" subelement to be discarded.  Unless you have taken steps
to first copy and reconstitute any existing annotations into the @p
annotation that is about to be assigned, it is likely that performing
such wholesale replacement is unfriendly towards other software

=item SBase::setSBOTerm

Sets the value of the "sboTerm" attribute.
Beginning with SBML Level 2 Version 3, objects derived from SBase have
an optional attribute named "sboTerm" for supporting the use of the
Systems Biology Ontology.  In SBML proper, the data type of the
attribute is a string of the form "SBO:NNNNNNN", where "NNNNNNN" is a
seven digit integer number; libSBML simplifies the representation by
only storing the NNNNNNN integer portion.  Thus, in libSBML, the
"sboTerm" attribute on SBase has data type C<int>, and SBO identifiers
are stored simply as integers. 
SBO terms are a type of optional annotation, and each different class
of SBML object derived from SBase imposes its own requirements about
the values permitted for "sboTerm".  Please consult the SBML
Level&nbsp;2 Version&nbsp;4 specification for more information about
the use of SBO and the "sboTerm" attribute.
@param value the NNNNNNN integer portion of the SBO identifier

=item SBase::setSBOTerm

Sets the value of the "sboTerm" attribute by string.
Beginning with SBML Level 2 Version 3, objects derived from SBase have
an optional attribute named "sboTerm" for supporting the use of the
Systems Biology Ontology.  In SBML proper, the data type of the
attribute is a string of the form "SBO:NNNNNNN", where "NNNNNNN" is a
seven digit integer number; libSBML simplifies the representation by
only storing the NNNNNNN integer portion.  Thus, in libSBML, the
"sboTerm" attribute on SBase has data type C<int>, and SBO identifiers
are stored simply as integers.  This method lets you set the value of
"sboTerm" as a complete string of the form "SBO:NNNNNNN", whereas
setSBOTerm(int value) allows you to set it using the integer form.
SBO terms are a type of optional annotation, and each different class
of SBML object derived from SBase imposes its own requirements about
the values permitted for "sboTerm".  Please consult the SBML
Level&nbsp;2 Version&nbsp;4 specification for more information about
the use of SBO and the "sboTerm" attribute.

The SBMLNamespaces object encapsulates SBML Level/Version/namespaces
information.  It is used to communicate the SBML Level, Version, and
(in Level&nbsp;3) packages used in addition to SBML Level&nbsp;3 Core.
@param xmlns the namespaces to set

@li @link OperationReturnValues_t#LIBSBML_OPERATION_SUCCESS LIBSBML_OPERATION_SUCCESS @endlink


=item SBase::unsetMetaId

Unsets the value of the "metaid" attribute of this SBML object.
The optional attribute named "metaid", present on every major SBML
component type, is for supporting metadata annotations using RDF
(Resource Description Format). The attribute value has the data type
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml/#id">XML ID</a>, the XML
identifier type, which means each "metaid" value must be globally
unique within an SBML file.  (Importantly, this uniqueness criterion
applies across any attribute with type <a
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml/#id">XML ID</a>, not just the
"metaid" attribute used by SBML&mdash;something to be aware of if your
application-specific XML content inside the "annotation" subelement
happens to use <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml/#id">XML ID</a>.)
The "metaid" value serves to identify a model component for purposes
such as referencing that component from metadata placed within
"annotation" subelements.
Returns integer value indicating success/failure of the
function.  The possible values
returned by this function are:

=item SBase::unsetId

Unsets the value of the "id" attribute of this SBML object.
Most (but not all) objects in SBML include two common attributes: "id"
and "name".  The identifier given by an object's "id" attribute value
is used to identify the object within the SBML model definition.
Other objects can refer to the component using this identifier.  The
data type of "id" is always either C<Sid> or
C<UnitSId>, depending on the object in question.  Both
data types are defined as follows:
C<ode>
letter ::= 'a'..'z','A'..'Z'
digit  ::= '0'..'9'
idChar ::= letter | digit | '_'
SId    ::= ( letter | '_' ) idChar 
@endcode

The equality of C<SId> and C<UnitSId> type values
in SBML is determined by an exact character sequence match; i.e.,
comparisons of these identifiers must be performed in a case-sensitive
manner.  This applies to all uses of C<SId> and
C<UnitSId>.

Returns integer value indicating success/failure of the
function.  The possible values
returned by this function are:
@li @link OperationReturnValues_t#LIBSBML_OPERATION_SUCCESS LIBSBML_OPERATION_SUCCESS @endlink
@li @link OperationReturnValues_t#LIBSBML_OPERATION_FAILED LIBSBML_OPERATION_FAILED @endlink


=item SBase::unsetName

Unsets the value of the "name" attribute of this SBML object.
Most (but not all) objects in SBML include two common attributes: "id"
and "name".  In contrast to the "id" attribute, the "name" attribute is
optional and is not intended to be used for cross-referencing purposes
within a model.  Its purpose instead is to provide a human-readable
label for the component.  The data type of "name" is the type
C<string> defined in XML Schema.  SBML imposes no
restrictions as to the content of "name" attributes beyond those
restrictions defined by the C<string> type in XML Schema.
The recommended practice for handling "name" is as follows.  If a
software tool has the capability for displaying the content of "name"
attributes, it should display this content to the user as a
component's label instead of the component's "id".  If the user
interface does not have this capability (e.g., because it cannot
display or use special characters in symbol names), or if the "name"
attribute is missing on a given component, then the user interface
should display the value of the "id" attribute instead.  (Script
language interpreters are especially likely to display "id" instead of
"name".)

As a consequence of the above, authors of systems that automatically
generate the values of "id" attributes should be aware some systems
may display the "id"'s to the user.  Authors therefore may wish to
take some care to have their software create "id" values that are: (a)
reasonably easy for humans to type and read; and (b) likely to be
meaningful, for example by making the "id" attribute be an abbreviated
form of the name attribute value.
An additional point worth mentioning is although there are
restrictions on the uniqueness of "id" values, there are no
restrictions on the uniqueness of "name" values in a model.  This
allows software packages leeway in assigning component identifiers.
Returns integer value indicating success/failure of the
function.  The possible values

=item SBase::unsetNotes

Unsets the value of the "notes" subelement of this SBML object.
The optional SBML element named "notes", present on every major SBML
component type, is intended as a place for storing optional
information intended to be seen by humans.  An example use of the
"notes" element would be to contain formatted user comments about the
model element in which the "notes" element is enclosed.  Every object
derived directly or indirectly from type SBase can have a separate
value for "notes", allowing users considerable freedom when adding

The format of "notes" elements must be <a target="_blank"

=item SBase::unsetAnnotation

Unsets the value of the "annotation" subelement of this SBML object.
Whereas the SBase "notes" subelement is a container for content to be
shown directly to humans, the "annotation" element is a container for
optional software-generated content I<not> meant to be shown to
humans.  Every object derived from SBase can have its own value for
"annotation".  The element's content type is <a target="_blank"
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-xml-20040204/#elemdecls">XML type
"any"</a>, allowing essentially arbitrary well-formed XML data

SBML places a few restrictions on the organization of the content of
annotations; these are intended to help software tools read and write
the data as well as help reduce conflicts between annotations added by
different tools.  Please see the SBML specifications for more details.

function.  The possible values returned by this function are:
@li @link OperationReturnValues_t#LIBSBML_OPERATION_SUCCESS LIBSBML_OPERATION_SUCCESS @endlink
@li @link OperationReturnValues_t#LIBSBML_OPERATION_FAILED LIBSBML_OPERATION_FAILED @endlink
@li @link OperationReturnValues_t#LIBSBML_UNEXPECTED_ATTRIBUTE LIBSBML_UNEXPECTED_ATTRIBUTE @endlink, if
this object lacks a "metaid" attribute
@li @link OperationReturnValues_t#LIBSBML_INVALID_OBJECT LIBSBML_INVALID_OBJECT @endlink
@note Since the CV Term uses the "metaid" attribute of the object as a
reference, if the object has no "metaid" attribute value set, then the
CVTerm will not be added.
@warning The fact that this method I<copies> the object passed to it
means that the caller will be left holding a physically different
object instance than the one contained in I<this> object.  Changes
made to the original object instance (such as resetting attribute
values) will <em>not affect the instance added here</em>.  In
addition, the caller should make sure to free the original object if
it is no longer being used, or else a memory leak will result.

=item SBase::getResourceBiologicalQualifier

Returns the MIRIAM <em>biological qualifier</em> associated with the
given resource.
In <a target="_blank" href="http://biomodels.net/miriam">MIRIAM</a>,
qualifiers are an optional means of indicating the relationship
between a model component and its annotations.  There are two broad
kinds of annotations: <em>model</em> and <em>biological</em>.  The
latter kind is used to qualify the relationship between a model
component and a biological entity which it represents.  Examples of
relationships include "is" and "has part", but many others are
possible.  MIRIAM defines <a target="_blank"
href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/miriam/main/qualifiers/">numerous
relationship qualifiers</a> to enable different software tools to
qualify biological annotations in the same standardized way.  In
libSBML, the MIRIAM controlled-vocabulary annotations on an SBML model
element are represented using lists of CVTerm objects, and the
enumeration #BiolQualifierType_t corresponds to the list of MIRIAM
biological qualifiers.
This method method searches the controlled-vocabulary annotations
(i.e., the list of CVTerm objects) on the present object, then out of
those that have biological qualifiers, looks for an annotation to the
given C<resource>.  If such an annotation is found, it returns the
type of biological qualifier associated with that resource as a 
value from  #BiolQualifierType_t.
@param resource string representing the resource; e.g.,
C<"http>://www.geneontology.org/#GO:0005892"
Returns the #BiolQualifierType_t value associated with the resource,
or @link BiolQualifierType_t#BQB_UNKNOWN BQB_UNKNOWN@endlink if the
resource does not exist.
@note The set of MIRIAM biological qualifiers grows over time,
although relatively slowly.  The values in the enumeration
#BiolQualifierType_t are up to date with MIRIAM at the time of a given
libSBML release.  The set of values may be expanded in later libSBML
releases, to match the values defined by MIRIAM at that later time.


=item SBase::getResourceModelQualifier

Returns the MIRIAM <em>model qualifier</em> associated with the
given resource.
In <a target="_blank" href="http://biomodels.net/miriam">MIRIAM</a>,
qualifiers are an optional means of indicating the relationship
between a model component and its annotations.  There are two broad
kinds of annotations: <em>model</em> and <em>biological</em>.  The
former kind is used to qualify the relationship between a model
component and another modeling object.  An example qualifier is
"isDerivedFrom", to indicate that a given component of the model is
derived from the modeling object represented by the referenced
resource.  MIRIAM defines <a target="_blank"
href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/miriam/main/qualifiers/">numerous
relationship qualifiers</a> to enable different software tools to
qualify model annotations in the same standardized way.  In libSBML,
the MIRIAM controlled-vocabulary annotations on an SBML model element
are represented using lists of CVTerm objects, and the enumeration
#ModelQualifierType_t corresponds to the list of MIRIAM model
qualifiers.

This method method searches the controlled-vocabulary annotations
(i.e., the list of CVTerm objects) on the present object, then out of
those that have model qualifiers, looks for an annotation to the given
C<resource>.  If such an annotation is found, it returns the type of
model qualifier associated with that resource as a value from
#ModelQualifierType_t.

@param resource string representing the resource; e.g., @c
"http://www.geneontology.org/#GO:0005892"

Returns the #ModelQualifierType_t value associated with the resource,
or @link ModelQualifierType_t#BQM_UNKNOWN BQM_UNKNOWN@endlink if the
resource does not exist.
@note The set of MIRIAM model qualifiers grows over time,
although relatively slowly.  The values in the enumeration
#ModelQualifierType_t are up to date with MIRIAM at the time of a given
libSBML release.  The set of values may be expanded in later libSBML
releases, to match the values defined by MIRIAM at that later time.

=head2 Model

LibSBML implementation of SBML's Model construct.
In an SBML model definition, a single object of class Model serves as
the overall container for the lists of the various model components.
All of the lists are optional, but if a given list container is present
within the model, the list must not be empty; that is, it must have
length one or more.  The following are the components and lists
permitted in different Levels and Versions of SBML as of this version
of libSBML (4.1):

=over


=item

In SBML Level 1, the components are: UnitDefinition, Compartment,
Species, Parameter, Rule, and Reaction.  Instances of the classes are
placed inside instances of classes ListOfUnitDefinitions,
ListOfCompartments, ListOfSpecies, ListOfParameters, ListOfRules, and
ListOfReactions.


=item

In SBML Level 2 Version 1, the components are: FunctionDefinition,
UnitDefinition, Compartment, Species, Parameter, Rule, Reaction and
Event.  Instances of the classes are placed inside instances of classes
ListOfFunctionDefinitions, ListOfUnitDefinitions, ListOfCompartments,
ListOfSpecies, ListOfParameters, ListOfRules, ListOfReactions, and
ListOfEvents.


=item

In SBML Level 2 Versions 2, 3 and 4, the components are:
FunctionDefinition, UnitDefinition, CompartmentType, SpeciesType,
Compartment, Species, Parameter, InitialAssignment, Rule, Constraint,
Reaction and Event.  Instances of the classes are placed inside
instances of classes ListOfFunctionDefinitions, ListOfUnitDefinitions,
ListOfCompartmentTypes, ListOfSpeciesTypes, ListOfCompartments,
ListOfSpecies, ListOfParameters, ListOfInitialAssignments, ListOfRules,
ListOfConstraints, ListOfReactions, and ListOfEvents.

=item

In SBML Level 3 Version 1, the components are: FunctionDefinition,
UnitDefinition, Compartment, Species, Parameter, InitialAssignment,
Rule, Constraint, Reaction and Event.  Instances of the classes are
placed inside instances of classes ListOfFunctionDefinitions,
ListOfUnitDefinitions, ListOfCompartments, ListOfSpecies,
ListOfParameters, ListOfInitialAssignments, ListOfRules,
ListOfConstraints, ListOfReactions, and ListOfEvents.  

=back


Although all the lists are optional, there are dependencies between SBML
components such that defining some components requires defining others.
An example is that defining a species requires defining a compartment,
and defining a reaction requires defining a species.  The dependencies
are explained in more detail in the SBML specifications.
In addition to the above lists and attributes, the Model class in both
SBML Level&nbsp;2 and Level&nbsp;3 has the usual two attributes of "id"
and "name", and both are optional.  As is the case for other SBML
components with "id" and "name" attributes, they must be used according
to the guidelines described in the SBML specifications.  (Within the
frameworks of SBML Level&nbsp;2 and Level&nbsp;3 Version&nbsp;1 Core, a
Model object identifier has no assigned meaning, but extension packages
planned for SBML Level&nbsp;3 are likely to make use of this
identifier.)

Finally, SBML Level&nbsp;3 has introduced a number of additional Model
attributes.  They are discussed in a separate section below.
@section approaches Approaches to creating objects using the libSBML API
LibSBML provides two main mechanisms for creating objects: class
constructors (e.g., @if clike @link Species::Species() Species()
@endlink @endif@if java <a
href="org/sbml/libsbml/Species.html">Species()</a> @endif), and
<code>create<span class="placeholder"><em>Object</em></span>()</code>
methods (such as Model::createSpecies()) provided by certain <span
class="placeholder"><em>Object</em></span> classes such as Model.  These
multiple mechanisms are provided by libSBML for flexibility and to
support different use-cases, but they also have different implications
for the overall model structure.
In general, the recommended approach is to use the <code>create<span
class="placeholder"><em>Object</em></span>()</code> methods.  These
methods both create an object I<and> link it to the parent in one step.
Here is an example:
@verbatim
// Create an SBMLDocument object in Level 3 Version 1 format:
SBMLDocument  sbmlDoc = new SBMLDocument(3, 1);
// Create a Model object inside the SBMLDocument object and set
// its identifier.  The call returns a pointer to the Model object
// created, and methods called on that object affect the attributes
// of the object attached to the model (as expected).
Model  model = sbmlDoc->createModel();
model->setId("MyModel");
// Create a Species object inside the Model and set its identifier.
// Similar to the lines above, this call returns a pointer to the Species
// object created, and methods called on that object affect the attributes
// of the object attached to the model (as expected).
Species  sp = model->createSpecies();
sp->setId("MySpecies");
@endverbatim
The <code>create<span
class="placeholder"><em>Object</em></span>()</code> methods return a
pointer to the object created, but they also add the object to the
relevant list of object instances contained in the parent.  (These lists
become the <code>&lt;listOf<i>Object</i>s&gt;</code> elements in the
finished XML rendition of SBML.)  In the example above,
Model::createSpecies() adds the created species directly to the
C<&lt;listOfSpecies&gt;> list in the model.  Subsequently,
methods called on the species change the species in the model (which is
what is expected in most situations).
By contrast, the other main way of creating an object and adding it to a
parent makes a I<copy> of the object, and requires more care on the
part of the caller.  Here is an example of this alternative approach:
@verbatim
// Create a Species object and add it to the model.
// This uses the Species class constructor:
Species  newsp = Species("MySpecies");
model->addSpecies(newsp); // Warning! This makes a COPY inside 'model'.
// addSpecies(...) copies the object, with the result that
// 'newsp' still refers to the original.  The following may not
// do what is expected:
newsp.setId("NewId");    // Warning -- doesn't change the species in 'model'!
// If 'newsp' object isn't going to be used further, it needs
// to be deleted to avoid a memory leak.
delete newsp;
@endverbatim
The key point of the example above is that, because the @if clike
Model::addSpecies() @endif@if java Model::addSpecies(Species s) @endif
call makes a copy of the object handed to it, care is needed both when
attempting to make changes to the object, and when the original object
is no longer needed.
@section checking Consistency and adherence to SBML specifications
To make it easier for applications to do whatever they need,
libSBML&nbsp;4.x is relatively lax when it comes to enforcing
correctness and completeness of models I<during> model construction and
editing.  Essentially, libSBML I<will> I<not> in most cases check
automatically that a model's components have valid attribute values, or
that the overall model is consistent and free of errors&mdash;even
obvious errors such as duplication of identifiers.  This allows
applications great leeway in how they build their models, but it means
that software authors must take deliberate steps to ensure that the
model will be, in the end, valid SBML.  These steps include such things
as keeping track of the identifiers used in a model, manually performing
updates in certain situations where an entity is referenced in more than
one place (e.g., a species that is referenced by multiple
SpeciesReference objects), and so on.
That said, libSBML does provide powerful features for deliberately
performing validation of SBML when an application decides it is time to
do so.  The interfaces to these facilities are on the SBMLDocument
class, in the form of SBMLDocument::checkInternalConsistency() and
SBMLDocument::checkConsistency().  Please refer to the documentation for
SBMLDocument for more information about this.
While applications may play fast and loose and live like free spirits
during the construction and editing of SBML models, they should always
make sure to call SBMLDocument::checkInternalConsistency() and/or
SBMLDocument::checkConsistency() before writing out the final version of
an SBML model.
@section model-l3-attrib Model attributes introduced in SBML Level&nbsp;3
As mentioned above, the Model class has a number of optional attributes
in SBML Level&nbsp;3 Version&nbsp;1 Core.  These are "substanceUnits",
"timeUnits", "volumeUnits", "areaUnits", "lengthUnits", "extentUnits",
and "conversionFactor.  The following provide more information about
them.

@subsection model-l3-substanceunits The "substanceUnits" attribute
The "substanceUnits" attribute is used to specify the unit of
measurement associated with substance quantities of Species objects that
do not specify units explicitly.  If a given Species object definition
does not specify its unit of substance quantity via the "substanceUnits"
attribute on the Species object instance, then that species inherits the
value of the Model "substanceUnits" attribute.  If the Model does not
define a value for this attribute, then there is no unit to inherit, and
all species that do not specify individual "substanceUnits" attribute
values then have <em>no</em> declared units for their quantities.  The
SBML Level&nbsp;3 Version&nbsp;1 Core specification provides more
details.

Note that when the identifier of a species appears in a model's
mathematical expressions, the unit of measurement associated with that
identifier is <em>not solely determined</em> by setting "substanceUnits"
on Model or Species.  Please see the discussion about units given in
the documentation for the Species class.
@subsection model-l3-timeunits The "timeUnits" attribute
The "timeUnits" attribute on SBML Level&nbsp;3's Model object is used to
specify the unit in which time is measured in the model.  This attribute
on Model is the <em>only</em> way to specify a unit for time in a model.
It is a global attribute; time is measured in the model everywhere in
the same way.  This is particularly relevant to Reaction and RateRule
objects in a model: all Reaction and RateRule objects in SBML define
per-time values, and the unit of time is given by the "timeUnits"
attribute on the Model object instance.  If the Model "timeUnits"
attribute has no value, it means that the unit of time is not defined
for the model's reactions and rate rules.  Leaving it unspecified in an
SBML model does not result in an invalid model in SBML Level&nbsp;3;
however, as a matter of best practice, we strongly recommend that all
models specify units of measurement for time.
@subsection model-l3-voletc The "volumeUnits", "areaUnits", and "lengthUnits" attributes
The attributes "volumeUnits", "areaUnits" and "lengthUnits" together are
used to set the units of measurements for the sizes of Compartment
objects in an SBML Level&nbsp;3 model when those objects do not
otherwise specify units.  The three attributes correspond to the most
common cases of compartment dimensions: "volumeUnits" for compartments
having a "spatialDimensions" attribute value of C<"3">, "areaUnits" for
compartments having a "spatialDimensions" attribute value of C<"2">, and
"lengthUnits" for compartments having a "spatialDimensions" attribute
value of C<"1">.  The attributes are not applicable to compartments
whose "spatialDimensions" attribute values are I<not> one of C<"1">, @c
"2" or C<"3">.
If a given Compartment object instance does not provide a value for its
"units" attribute, then the unit of measurement of that compartment's
size is inherited from the value specified by the Model "volumeUnits",
"areaUnits" or "lengthUnits" attribute, as appropriate based on the
Compartment object's "spatialDimensions" attribute value.  If the Model
object does not define the relevant attribute, then there are no units
to inherit, and all Compartment objects that do not set a value for
their "units" attribute then have <em>no</em> units associated with
their compartment sizes.
The use of three separate attributes is a carry-over from SBML
Level&nbsp;2.  Note that it is entirely possible for a model to define a
value for two or more of the attributes "volumeUnits", "areaUnits" and
"lengthUnits" simultaneously, because SBML models may contain
compartments with different numbers of dimensions.
@subsection model-l3-extentunits The "extentUnits" attribute
Reactions are processes that occur over time.  These processes involve
events of some sort, where a single ``reaction event'' is one in which
some set of entities (known as reactants, products and modifiers in
SBML) interact, once.  The <em>extent</em> of a reaction is a measure of
how many times the reaction has occurred, while the time derivative of
the extent gives the instantaneous rate at which the reaction is
occurring.  Thus, what is colloquially referred to as the "rate of the
reaction" is in fact equal to the rate of change of reaction extent.
In SBML Level&nbsp;3, the combination of "extentUnits" and "timeUnits"
defines the units of kinetic laws in SBML and establishes how the
numerical value of each KineticLaw object's mathematical formula is
meant to be interpreted in a model.  The units of the kinetic laws are
taken to be "extentUnits" divided by "timeUnits".
Note that this embodies an important principle in SBML Level&nbsp;3
models: <em>all reactions in an SBML model must have the same units</em>
for the rate of change of extent.  In other words, the units of all
reaction rates in the model <em>must be the same</em>.  There is only
one global value for "extentUnits" and one global value for "timeUnits".
@subsection model-l3-convfactor The "conversionFactor" attribute
The attribute "conversionFactor" in SBML Level&nbsp;3's Model object
defines a global value inherited by all Species object instances that do
not define separate values for their "conversionFactor" attributes.  The
value of this attribute must refer to a Parameter object instance
defined in the model.  The Parameter object in question must be a
constant; ie it must have its "constant" attribute value set to @c
"true".

If a given Species object definition does not specify a conversion
factor via the "conversionFactor" attribute on Species, then the species
inherits the conversion factor specified by the Model "conversionFactor"
attribute.  If the Model does not define a value for this attribute,
then there is no conversion factor to inherit.  More information about
conversion factors is provided in the SBML Level&nbsp;3 Version&nbsp;1
specification.


=over

=item Model::Model

Creates a new Model using the given SBML C<level> and C<version>
values.

@param level an unsigned int, the SBML Level to assign to this Model
@param version an unsigned int, the SBML Version to assign to this
Model

@note Upon the addition of a Model object to an SBMLDocument
(e.g., using Model::addModel()), the SBML Level, SBML Version
and XML namespace of the document I<override> the values used
when creating the Model object via this constructor.  This is
necessary to ensure that an SBML document is a consistent structure.
Nevertheless, the ability to supply the values at the time of creation
of a Model is an important aid to producing valid SBML.  Knowledge
of the intented SBML Level and Version determine whether it is valid
to assign a particular value to an attribute, or whether it is valid
to add an object to an existing SBMLDocument.


=item Model::Model

Creates a new Model using the given SBMLNamespaces object
C<sbmlns>.
The SBMLNamespaces object encapsulates SBML Level/Version/namespaces
information.  It is used to communicate the SBML Level, Version, and
(in Level&nbsp;3) packages used in addition to SBML Level&nbsp;3 Core.
A common approach to using this class constructor is to create an
SBMLNamespaces object somewhere in a program, once, then pass it to
object constructors such as this one when needed.
@param sbmlns an SBMLNamespaces object.
@note Upon the addition of a Model object to an SBMLDocument (e.g.,
using Model::addModel()), the SBML XML namespace of the document @em
overrides the value used when creating the Model object via this
constructor.  This is necessary to ensure that an SBML document is a
consistent structure.  Nevertheless, the ability to supply the values
at the time of creation of a Model is an important aid to producing
valid SBML.  Knowledge of the intented SBML Level and Version
determine whether it is valid to assign a particular value to an
attribute, or whether it is valid to add an object to an existing
SBMLDocument.

=head2 SBMLDocument

Container for an SBML document and interface for global operations
on SBML documents.
@if clike LibSBML uses the class SBMLDocument as a
top-level container for storing SBML content and data associated with it
(such as warnings and error messages).  The two primary means of reading
an SBML model, SBMLReader::readSBML() and
SBMLReader::readSBMLFromString(), both return a pointer to an
SBMLDocument object.  From there, callers can inquire about any errors
encountered (e.g., using SBMLDocument::getNumErrors()), access the Model
object, and perform other actions such as consistency-checking and model
translation. @endif@if java LibSBML uses the class
SBMLDocument as a top-level container for storing SBML content and data
associated with it (such as warnings and error messages).  The two
primary means of reading an SBML model, SBMLReader::readSBML(String
filename) and SBMLReader::readSBMLFromString(String xml), both return a
pointer to an SBMLDocument object.  From there, callers can inquire
about any errors encountered (e.g., using SBMLDocument::getNumErrors()),
access the Model object, and perform other actions such as
consistency-checking and model translation. @endif
When creating fresh models programmatically, the starting point is
typically the creation of an SBMLDocument object instance.  The
SBMLDocument constructor accepts arguments for the SBML Level and
Version of the model to be created.  After creating the SBMLDocument
object, calling programs then typically call SBMLDocument::createModel()
almost immediately, and then proceed to call the methods on the Model
object to fill out the model's contents.
SBMLDocument corresponds roughly to the class <i>Sbml</i> defined in the
SBML Level&nbsp;2 specification.  It does not have a direct
correspondence in SBML Level&nbsp;1.  (However, to make matters simpler
for applications, libSBML creates an SBMLDocument no matter whether the model
is Level&nbsp;1 or Level&nbsp;2.)  In its barest form, when written out
in XML format for SBML Level&nbsp;2 Version&nbsp;4, the corresponding
structure is the following:
@verbatim
<sbml xmlns="http://www.sbml.org/sbml/level2/version4" level="2" version="4"
...
</sbml>
@endverbatim
SBMLDocument is derived from SBase, and therefore contains the usual SBase
attributes (in SBML Level&nbsp;2 Version&nbsp;4) of "metaid" and "sboTerm", as
well as the subelements "notes" and "annotation".  It also contains the
attributes "level" and "version" indicating the Level and Version of the
SBML data structure.  These can be accessed using the methods defined by
the SBase class for that purpose.
@section checking Checking consistency and adherence to SBML specifications
One of the most important features of libSBML is its ability to perform
SBML validation to ensure that a model adheres to the SBML specification
for whatever Level+Version combination the model uses.  SBMLDocument
provides the methods for running consistency-checking and validation
rules on the SBML content.
First, a brief explanation of the rationale is in order.  In libSBML
versions up to and including the version 3.3.x series, the individual
methods for creating and setting attributes and other components are
quite lenient, and allow a caller to compose SBML entities that may not,
in the end, represent valid SBML.  This allows applications the freedom
to do things such as save incomplete models (which is useful when models
are being developed over long periods of time), but at the same time, it
means that a separate validation step is necessary when a calling
program finally wants to finish a complete SBML document.
The primary interface to this facility is SBMLDocument's
SBMLDocument::checkInternalConsistency() and
SBMLDocument::checkConsistency().  The former verifies the basic
internal consistency and syntax of an SBML document, and the latter
implements more elaborate validation rules (both those defined by the
SBML specifications, as well as additional rules offered by libSBML).
@if clike The checks performed by
SBMLDocument::checkInternalConsistency() are hardwired and cannot be
changed by calling programs, but the validation performed by
SBMLDocument::checkConsistency() is under program control using the
method SBMLDocument::setConsistencyChecks().  Applications can
selectively disable specific kinds of checks that they may not be
interested in, by calling SBMLDocument::setConsistencyChecks() with
appropriate parameters.  @endif@if java The checks
performed by SBMLDocument::checkInternalConsistency() are hardwired and
cannot be changed by calling programs, but the validation performed by
SBMLDocument::checkConsistency() is under program control using the
method SBMLDocument::setConsistencyChecks(int categ, boolean onoff).
Applications can selectively disable specific kinds of checks that they
may not be interested by calling SBMLDocument::setConsistencyChecks(int
categ, boolean onoff) with appropriate parameters. @endif
These methods have slightly different relevance depending on whether a
model is created programmaticaly from scratch, or whether it is read in
from a file or data stream.  The following table summarizes the possible
scenarios.

and validation facilities is provided in this manual in the
section @ref libsbml-example. @endif
@section converting Converting documents between Levels and Versions of SBML
LibSBML provides facilities for limited translation of SBML between
Levels and Versions of the SBML specifications.  The method for doing is
is @if clike SBMLDocument::setLevelAndVersion() @endif@if java SBMLDocument::setLevelAndVersion(long lev, long ver, boolean strict) @endif.  In 
general, models can be converted upward without difficulty (e.g., from
SBML Level&nbsp;1 to Level&nbsp;2, or from an earlier Version of
Level&nbsp;2 to the latest Version of Level&nbsp;2).  Sometimes models
can be translated downward as well, if they do not use constructs
specific to more advanced Levels of SBML.
Calling @if clike SBMLDocument::setLevelAndVersion() @endif@if java SBMLDocument::setLevelAndVersion(long lev, long ver, boolean strict) @endif will not I<necessarily> lead
to a successful conversion.  The method will return a boolean value
to indicate success or failure.  Callers must check the error log (see 
next section) attached to the SBMLDocument object after calling
@if clike SBMLDocument::setLevelAndVersion() @endif@if java SBMLDocument::setLevelAndVersion(long lev, long ver) @endif in order to assess whether any
problems arose.
If an application is interested in translating to a lower Level and/or
Version of SBML within a Level, the following methods allow for prior
assessment of whether there is sufficient compatibility to make a
translation possible:
@li SBMLDocument::checkL1Compatibility(),
@li SBMLDocument::checkL2v1Compatibility(),
@li SBMLDocument::checkL2v2Compatibility(),
@li SBMLDocument::checkL2v3Compatibility(), and
@li SBMLDocument::checkL2v4Compatibility().
Some changes between Versions of SBML Level&nbsp;2 may lead to
unexpected behaviors when attempting conversions in either direction.
For example, SBML Level&nbsp;2 Version&nbsp;4 relaxed the requirement
for consistency in units of measurement between expressions annd
quantities in a model.  As a result, a model written in Version&nbsp;4,
if converted to Version&nbsp;3 with no other changes, may fail
validation as a Version&nbsp;3 model because Version&nbsp;3 imposed
stricter requirements on unit consistency.
@section errors Error handling
Upon reading a model, SBMLDocument logs any problems encountered while
reading the model from the file or data stream.  The log contains
objects that record diagnostic information about any notable issues that
arose.  Whether the problems are warnings or errors, they are both
reported through a single common interface involving the object class
SBMLError.

The methods SBMLDocument::getNumErrors(), @if clike SBMLDocument::getError() @endif@if java SBMLDocument::getError(long n) @endif and
SBMLDocument::printErrors() allow callers to interact with the warnings
or errors logged.  Alternatively, callers may retrieve the entire log as
an SBMLErrorLog object using the method SBMLDocument::getErrorLog().
The SBMLErrorLog object provides some alternative methods for
interacting with the set of errors and warnings.  In either case,
applications typically should first call SBMLDocument::getNumErrors() to
find out if any issues have been logged after specific libSBML
operations such as the ones discussed in the sections above.  If they
have, then an application will should proceed to inspect the individual
reports using either the direct interfaces on SBMLDocument or using the
methods on the SBMLErrorLog object.
@if clike An example of using the error facility is
provided in this manual in the
section @ref libsbml-example. @endif

not added until the model is written out, <em>or</em> the method
@if clike SBMLDocument::setLevelAndVersion() @endif@if java SBMLDocument::setLevelAndVersion(long lev, long ver, boolean strict) @endif is called.  This may be important to keep in mind

=item SBMLDocument::SBMLDocument

Copy constructor; creates a copy of this SBMLDocument.


=item SBMLDocument::accept

Accepts the given SBMLVisitor for this instance of SBMLDocument.
@param v the SBMLVisitor instance to be used.
Returns the result of calling C<v.visit()>.


=item SBMLDocument::clone

Creates and returns a deep copy of this SBMLDocument.
Returns a (deep) copy of this SBMLDocument.


=item SBMLDocument::getModel

Returns the Model object stored in this SBMLDocument.
It is important to note that this method <em>does not create</em> a
Model instance.  The model in the SBMLDocument must have been created
at some prior time, for example using SBMLDocument::createModel() 
or @if clike SBMLDocument::setModel() @endif@if java SBMLDocument::setModel(Model m) @endif.
This method returns C<NULL> if a model does not yet exist.
Returns the Model contained in this SBMLDocument.
@see createModel()


=item SBMLDocument::getModel

Returns the Model object stored in this SBMLDocument.
It is important to note that this method <em>does not create</em> a
Model instance.  The model in the SBMLDocument must have been created
at some prior time, for example using SBMLDocument::createModel() 
or @if clike SBMLDocument::setModel() @endif@if java SBMLDocument::setModel(Model m) @endif.
This method returns C<NULL> if a model does not yet exist.
Returns the Model contained in this SBMLDocument.
@see createModel()


=item SBMLDocument::expandFunctionDefinitions

Removes any FunctionDefinitions from the document and expands
any instances of their use within &lt;math&gt; elements.
For example a Model contains a FunctionDefinition with id f
representing the math expression: f(x, y) = x   y.
The math element of the KineticLaw uses f(s, p).
The outcome of the function is that the math of the KineticLaw
now represents the math expression: s   p and the model no longer
contains any FunctionDefinitions.
Returns bool C<true> if the transformation was successful, 
C<false>, otherwise.
@note This function will check the consistency of a model
before attemptimg the transformation.  In the case of a model
with invalid SBML the transformation will not be done and the
function will return C<false>.


=item SBMLDocument::expandInitialAssignments

Removes any InitialAssignments from the document and replaces
the appropriate values.
For example a Model contains a InitialAssignment with symbol k
where k is the id of a Parameter.
The outcome of the function is that the value attribute of
the Parameter is the value calculated using the math expression
of the InitialAssignment and the corresponding InitialAssignment
has been removed from the Model.
Returns bool C<true> if the transformation was successful, 
C<false>, otherwise.
@note This function will check the consistency of a model
before attemptimg the transformation.  In the case of a model
with invalid SBML the transformation will not be done and the
function will return C<false>.  As part of the process the 
function will check that it has values for any components
referred to by the math elements of InitialAssignments.  In
the case where not all values have been declared the particular
InitialAssignment will not be removed and the function will 
return C<false>.


=item SBMLDocument::setLevelAndVersion

Sets the SBML Level and Version of this SBMLDocument instance,
attempting to convert the model as needed.
This method is the principal way in libSBML to convert models between
Levels and Versions of SBML.  Generally, models can be converted
upward without difficulty (e.g., from SBML Level&nbsp;1 to
Level&nbsp;2, or from an earlier Version of Level&nbsp;2 to the latest
Version of Level&nbsp;2).  Sometimes models can be translated downward
as well, if they do not use constructs specific to more advanced
Levels of SBML.
Before calling this method, callers may check compatibility directly
using the methods SBMLDocument::checkL1Compatibility(),
SBMLDocument::checkL2v1Compatibility(),
SBMLDocument::checkL2v2Compatibility(),
SBMLDocument::checkL2v3Compatibility() and
SBMLDocument::checkL2v4Compatibility().

The valid combinations of SBML Level and Version as of this release
of libSBML are the following: 

=over


=item

Level&nbsp;1 Version&nbsp;2

=item

Level&nbsp;2 Version&nbsp;1

@param level the desired SBML Level
@param version the desired Version within the SBML Level
@param strict boolean indicating whether to check consistency
of both the source and target model when performing
conversion (defaults to C< true >)
@note Calling this method will not I<necessarily> lead to a successful
conversion.  If the conversion fails, it will be logged in the error
list associated with this SBMLDocument.  Callers should consult
getNumErrors() to find out if the conversion succeeded without
problems.  For conversions from Level&nbsp;2 to Level&nbsp;1, callers
can also check the Level of the model after calling this method to
find out whether it is Level&nbsp;1.  (If the conversion to
Level&nbsp;1 failed, the Level of this model will be left unchanged.)
@see checkL1Compatibility()
@see checkL2v1Compatibility()
@see checkL2v2Compatibility()
@see checkL2v3Compatibility()
@see checkL2v4Compatibility()
Strict conversion applies the additional criteria that both the source
and the target model must be consistent SBML.  Users can control the
consistency checks that are applied using the 
SBMLDocument::setConsistencyChecksForConversion function.  If either 
the source
or the potential target model have validation errors, the conversion
is not performed.  When a strict conversion is successful, the
underlying SBML object model is altered to reflect the new level
and version.  Thus information that cannot be converted (e.g. sboTerms)
will be lost.   


=item SBMLDocument::setModel

Sets the Model for this SBMLDocument to a copy of the given Model.
@param m the new Model to use.
Returns integer value indicating success/failure of the
function.  @if clike The value is drawn from the
enumeration #OperationReturnValues_t. @endif The possible values

Creates a new Model inside this SBMLDocument, and returns a pointer to
it.

In SBML Level&nbsp;2, the use of an identifier on a Model object is
optional.  This method takes an optional argument, C<sid>, for setting
the identifier.  If not supplied, the identifier attribute on the
Model instance is not set.

=item SBMLDocument::setConsistencyChecks

Controls the consistency checks that are performed when
SBMLDocument::checkConsistency() is called.
This method works by adding or subtracting consistency checks from the
set of all possible checks that SBMLDocument::checkConsistency() knows
how to perform.  This method may need to be called multiple times in
order to achieve the desired combination of checks.  The first
argument (C<category>) in a call to this method indicates the category
of consistency/error checks that are to be turned on or off, and the
second argument (C<apply>, a boolean) indicates whether to turn it on
(value of C<true>) or off (value of C<false>).
The possible categories (values to the argument C<category>) are the
set of values from the enumeration #SBMLErrorCategory_t.  The
following are the possible choices in libSBML version&nbsp;3.3.x:
@li C<LIBSBML_CAT_GENERAL_CONSISTENCY>: Correctness and consistency of
specific SBML language constructs.  Performing this set of checks is
highly recommended.  With respect to the SBML specification, these
concern failures in applying the validation rules numbered 2xxxx in
the Level&nbsp;2 Versions&nbsp;2, 3 and&nbsp;4 specifications.
@li C<LIBSBML_CAT_IDENTIFIER_CONSISTENCY>: Correctness and consistency

=item SBMLDocument::checkConsistency

Performs consistency checking and validation on this SBML document.
If this method returns a nonzero value (meaning, one or more
consistency checks have failed for SBML document), the failures may be
due to warnings I<or> errors.  Callers should inspect the severity
flag in the individual SBMLError objects returned by

=head2 FunctionDefinition

LibSBML implementation of SBML's FunctionDefinition construct.
The FunctionDefinition structure associates an identifier with a
function definition.  This identifier can then be used as the function
called in subsequent MathML content elsewhere in an SBML model.
FunctionDefinition has one required attribute, "id", to give the
function a unique identifier by which other parts of an SBML model
definition can refer to it.  A FunctionDefinition instance can also have
an optional "name" attribute of type C<string>.  Identifiers and names
must be used according to the guidelines described in the SBML
specification (e.g., Section 3.3 in the Level 2 Version 4
specification).

FunctionDefinition has a required "math" subelement containing a MathML
expression defining the function body.  The content of this element can
only be a MathML "lambda" element.  The "lambda" element must begin with
zero or more "bvar" elements, followed by any other of the elements in
the MathML subset allowed in SBML Level 2 I<except> "lambda" (i.e., a
"lambda" element cannot contain another "lambda" element).  This is the
only place in SBML where a "lambda" element can be used.  The function
defined by a FunctionDefinition is only available for use in other
MathML elements that I<follow> the FunctionDefinition definition in the
model.  (These restrictions prevent recursive and mutually-recursive
functions from being expressed.)
A further restriction on the content of "math" is that it cannot contain
references to variables other than the variables declared to the
"lambda" itself.  That is, the contents of MathML "ci" elements inside
the body of the "lambda" can only be the variables declared by its
"bvar" elements, or the identifiers of other FunctionDefinition
instances earlier in the model.  This means must be written so that all
variables or parameters used in the MathML content are passed to them
via their function parameters.
@note Function definitions (also informally known as user-defined
functions) were introduced in SBML Level 2.  They have purposefully
limited capabilities.  A function cannot reference parameters or other
model quantities outside of itself; values must be passed as parameters
to the function.  Moreover, recursive and mutually-recursive functions
are not permitted.  The purpose of these limitations is to balance power
against complexity of implementation.  With the restrictions as they
are, function definitions could be implemented as textual
substitutions&mdash;they are simply macros.  Software implementations
therefore do not need the full function-definition machinery typically
associated with programming languages.
@note Another important point to note is FunctionDefinition does not
have a separate attribute for defining the units of the value returned
by the function.  The units associated with the function's return value,
when the function is called from within MathML expressions elsewhere in
SBML, are simply the overall units of the expression in
FunctionDefinition's "math" subelement when applied to the arguments
supplied in the call to the function.  Ascertaining these units requires
performing dimensional analysis on the expression.  (Readers may wonder
why there is no attribute.  The reason is that having a separate
attribute for declaring the units would not only be redundant, but also
lead to the potential for having conflicting information.  In the case
of a conflict between the declared units and those of the value actually
returned by the function, the only logical resolution rule would be to
assume that the correct units are those of the expression anyway.)

=head2 ListOfFunctionDefinitions

LibSBML implementation of SBML's ListOfFunctionDefinitions construct.
The various ListOf___ classes in SBML are merely containers used for
organizing the main components of an SBML model.  All are derived from
the abstract class SBase, and inherit the various attributes and
subelements of SBase, such as "metaid" as and "annotation".  The
ListOf___ classes do not add any attributes of their own.
The relationship between the lists and the rest of an SBML model is
illustrated by the following (for SBML Level&nbsp;2 Version&nbsp;4):
@image html listof-illustration.jpg "ListOf___ elements in an SBML Model"
@image latex listof-illustration.jpg "ListOf___ elements in an SBML Model"
Readers may wonder about the motivations for using the ListOf___
containers.  A simpler approach in XML might be to place the components
all directly at the top level of the model definition.  We chose instead
to group them within XML elements named after ListOf<em>Classname</em>,
in part because we believe this helps organize the components and makes
visual reading of models in XML easier.  More importantly, the fact that
the container classes are derived from SBase means that software tools
can add information about the lists themselves into each list
container's "annotation".

=item FunctionDefinition::FunctionDefinition

Creates a new FunctionDefinition using the given SBML C<level> and C<version>
values.

@param level an unsigned int, the SBML Level to assign to this FunctionDefinition
@param version an unsigned int, the SBML Version to assign to this
FunctionDefinition

@note Upon the addition of a FunctionDefinition object to an
SBMLDocument (e.g., using Model::addFunctionDefinition()), the SBML
Level, SBML Version and XML namespace of the document @em
override the values used when creating the FunctionDefinition object
via this constructor.  This is necessary to ensure that an SBML
document is a consistent structure.  Nevertheless, the ability to
supply the values at the time of creation of a FunctionDefinition is
an important aid to producing valid SBML.  Knowledge of the intented
SBML Level and Version determine whether it is valid to assign a
particular value to an attribute, or whether it is valid to add an
object to an existing SBMLDocument.


=item FunctionDefinition::FunctionDefinition

Creates a new FunctionDefinition using the given SBMLNamespaces object
C<sbmlns>.
The SBMLNamespaces object encapsulates SBML Level/Version/namespaces
information.  It is used to communicate the SBML Level, Version, and
(in Level&nbsp;3) packages used in addition to SBML Level&nbsp;3 Core.
A common approach to using this class constructor is to create an
SBMLNamespaces object somewhere in a program, once, then pass it to
object constructors such as this one when needed.
@param sbmlns an SBMLNamespaces object.
@note Upon the addition of a FunctionDefinition object to an
SBMLDocument (e.g., using Model::addFunctionDefinition()), the SBML
XML namespace of the document I<overrides> the value used when

=head2 Unit

LibSBML implementation of SBML's Unit construct.
The SBML unit definition facility uses two classes of objects,
UnitDefinition and Unit.  The approach to defining units in SBML is
compositional; for example, <em>meter second<sup> &ndash;2</sup></em> is
constructed by combining a Unit object representing <em>meter</em> with
another Unit object representing <em>second<sup> &ndash;2</sup></em>.
The combination is wrapped inside a UnitDefinition, which provides for
assigning an identifier and optional name to the combination.  The
identifier can then be referenced from elsewhere in a model.  Thus, the
UnitDefinition class is the container, and Unit instances are placed
inside UnitDefinition instances.
A Unit structure has four attributes named "kind", "exponent", "scale"
and "multiplier".  It represents a (possibly transformed) reference to a
base unit.  The attribute "kind" on Unit indicates the chosen base unit.
Its value must be one of the text strings listed below; this list
corresponds to SBML Level&nbsp;3 Version&nbsp;1 Core:
@htmlinclude base-units.html
This list of predefined base units is nearly identical in SBML
Level&nbsp;2 Version&nbsp;4, the exception being that Level&nbsp;2 does
not define C<avogadro>.  In SBML Level&nbsp;2 Version&nbsp;1 models, the
string C<Celsius> is also permitted.  In SBML Level&nbsp;1 models, the
strings C<meter> and C<liter> are also permitted.  In libSBML, each of
the predefined base unit names is represented by an enumeration value in
#UnitKind_t, discussed in a separate section below.
The attribute named "exponent" on Unit represents an exponent on the
unit.  In SBML Level&nbsp;2, the attribute is optional and has a default
value of C<1> (one); in SBML Level&nbsp;3, the attribute is mandatory
and there is no default value.  A Unit structure also has an attribute
called "scale"; its value must be an integer exponent for a power-of-ten
multiplier used to set the scale of the unit.  For example, a unit
having a "kind" value of C<gram> and a "scale" value of C<-3> signifies
10<sup>&nbsp;&ndash;3</sup> \f$\times\f$ gram, or milligrams.  In SBML
Level&nbsp;2, the attribute is optional and has a default value of C<0>
(zero), because 10<sup> 0</sup> = 1; in SBML Level&nbsp;3, the attribute
is mandatory and has no default value.  Lastly, the attribute named
"multiplier" can be used to multiply the unit by a real-numbered factor;
this enables the definition of units that are not power-of-ten multiples
of SI units.  For instance, a multiplier of 0.3048 could be used to
define C<foot> as a measure of length in terms of a C<metre>.  The
"multiplier" attribute is optional in SBML Level&nbsp;2, where it has a
default value of C<1> (one); in SBML Level&nbsp;3, the attribute is
mandatory and has not default value.
<h3><a class="anchor" name="UnitKind_t">UnitKind_t</a></h3>
As discussed above, SBML defines a set of base units which serves as the
starting point for new unit definitions.  This set of base units
consists of the SI units and a small number of additional convenience
units.

@if clike Until SBML Level&nbsp;2 Version&nbsp;3, there
existed a data type in the SBML specifications called C<UnitKind>,
enumerating the possible SBML base units.  Although SBML Level&nbsp;2
Version&nbsp;3 removed this type from the language specification,
libSBML maintains the corresponding enumeration type #UnitKind_t as a
convenience and as a way to provide backward compatibility to previous
SBML Level/Version specifications.  (The removal in SBML Level&nbsp;2
Version&nbsp;3 of the enumeration C<UnitKind> was also accompanied by
the redefinition of the data type C<UnitSId> to include the previous @c
UnitKind values as reserved symbols in the C<UnitSId> space.  This
change has no net effect on permissible models, their representation or
their syntax.  The purpose of the change in the SBML specification was
simply to clean up an inconsistency about the contexts in which these
values were usable.)
@endif@if java In SBML Level&nbsp;2 Versions before
Version&nbsp;3, there existed an enumeration of units called @c
UnitKind.  In Version&nbsp;3, this enumeration was removed and the
identifier class C<UnitSId> redefined to include the previous @c
UnitKind values as reserved symbols.  This change has no net effect on
permissible models, their representation or their syntax.  The purpose
of the change in the SBML specification was simply to clean up an
inconsistency about the contexts in which these values were usable.
However, LibSBML maintains UnitKind in the form of of a set of static
integer constants whose names begin with the characters
C<UNIT_KIND_>.  These constants are defined in the class
<code><a href="libsbmlConstants.html">libsbmlConstants</a></code>.
@endif

As a consequence of the fact that libSBML supports models in all Levels
and Versions of SBML, libSBML's set of C<UNIT_KIND_> values is a union
of all the possible base unit names defined in the different SBML
specifications.  However, not every base unit is allowed in every
Level+Version combination of SBML.  Note in particular the following
exceptions:

=over


=item

The alternate spelling C<"meter"> is included in
addition to the official SI spelling C<"metre">.  This spelling is only
permitted in SBML Level&nbsp;1 models.

=item

The alternate spelling C<"liter"> is included in addition to the
official SI spelling C<"litre">.  This spelling is only permitted in
SBML Level&nbsp;1 models.

=item

The unit C<"Celsius"> is included because of its presence in
specifications of SBML prior to SBML Level&nbsp;2 Version&nbsp;3.

=item

The unit C<avogadro> was introduced in SBML Level&nbsp;3, and
is only permitted for use in SBML Level&nbsp;3 models.

object constructors such as this one when needed.

@param v the SBMLVisitor instance to be used.
Returns the result of calling C<v.visit()>, which indicates
whether the Visitor would like to visit the next Unit in the list
of units within which this Unit is embedded (i.e., in the ListOfUnits
located in the enclosing UnitDefinition instance).


=item Unit::clone

Creates and returns a deep copy of this Unit.
Returns a (deep) copy of this Unit.


=item Unit::initDefaults

Initializes the fields of this Unit object to "typical" default
values.

The SBML Unit component has slightly different aspects and default
attribute values in different SBML Levels and Versions.  This method
sets the values to certain common defaults, based mostly on what they
are in SBML Level&nbsp;2.  Specifically:

=over


=item

Sets attribute "exponent" to C<1>

=item

Sets attribute "scale" to C<0>

=item

Sets attribute "multiplier" to C<1>.0

=back


The "kind" attribute is left unchanged.


=item Unit::getKind

Returns the "kind" of Unit this is.
Returns the value of the "kind" attribute of this Unit as a value from
the <a class="el" href="#UnitKind_t">UnitKind_t</a> enumeration.


=item Unit::getExponent

Returns the value of the "exponent" attribute of this unit.
Returns the "exponent" value of this Unit, as an integer.

@warning The "offset" attribute is only available in SBML Level&nbsp;2
Version&nbsp;1.  This attribute is not present in SBML Level&nbsp;2
Version&nbsp;2 or above.  When producing SBML models using these later
specifications, modelers and software tools need to account for units
with offsets explicitly.  The SBML specification document offers a
number of suggestions for how to achieve this.  LibSBML methods such
as this one related to "offset" are retained for compatibility with
earlier versions of SBML Level&nbsp;2, but their use is strongly
discouraged.

Returns the "offset" value of this Unit, as a double.

that the "offset" attribute was removed from Unit definitions.
LibSBML methods such as this one related to C<Celsius> are retained in
order to support SBML Level&nbsp;2 Version&nbsp;1, but their use is
strongly discouraged.

@see getElementName()


=item Unit::getElementName

always C<"unit">.
Returns the name of this element, i.e., C<"unit">. 


=item Unit::isBuiltIn

Predicate to test whether a given string is the name of a
predefined SBML unit.
@param name a string to be tested against the predefined unit names
@param level the Level of SBML for which the determination should be
made.  This is necessary because there are a few small differences
in allowed units between SBML Level&nbsp;1 and Level&nbsp;2.
Returns C<true> if C<name> is one of the five SBML predefined unit
identifiers (C<"substance">, C<"volume">, C<"area">, C<"length"> or @c
"time"), C<false> otherwise.
@note The predefined unit identifiers C<"length"> and C<"area"> were
added in Level&nbsp;2 Version&nbsp;1


=item Unit::isUnitKind

Predicate to test whether a given string is the name of a valid
base unit in SBML (such as C<"gram"> or C<"mole">).
This method exists because prior to SBML Level&nbsp;2 Version&nbsp;3,
an enumeration called C<UnitKind> was defined by SBML.  This enumeration
was removed in SBML Level&nbsp;2 Version&nbsp;3 and its values were
folded into the space of values of a type called C<UnitSId>.  This method
therefore has less significance in SBML Level&nbsp;2 Version&nbsp;3
and Level&nbsp;2 Version&nbsp;4, but remains for backward
compatibility and support for reading models in older Versions of
Level&nbsp;2.

@param name a string to be tested
@param level an unsigned int representing the SBML specification
Level 

@param version an unsigned int representing the SBML specification
Version

Returns C<true> if name is a valid UnitKind, C<false> otherwise
@note The allowed unit names differ between SBML Levels&nbsp;1
and&nbsp;2 and again slightly between Level&nbsp;2 Versions&nbsp;1
and&nbsp;2.



=item Unit::areIdentical

Predicate returning C<true> if two
Unit objects are identical.
Two Unit objects are considered to be I<identical> if they match in
all attributes.  (Contrast this to the method areEquivalent(), which
compares Unit objects only with respect to certain attributes.)
@param unit1 the first Unit object to compare
@param unit2 the second Unit object to compare
Returns C<true> if all the attributes of unit1 are identical
to the attributes of unit2, C<false> otherwise.
@see areEquivalent()


=item Unit::areEquivalent

Predicate returning C<true> if 
Unit objects are equivalent.
Two Unit objects are considered to be I<equivalent> either if (1) both
have a "kind" attribute value of C<dimensionless>, or (2) their "kind",
"exponent" and (for SBML Level&nbsp;2 Version&nbsp;1) "offset"
attribute values are equal. (Contrast this to the method
areIdentical(), which compares Unit objects with respect to all
attributes, not just the "kind" and "exponent".)
@param unit1 the first Unit object to compare
@param unit2 the second Unit object to compare
Returns C<true> if the "kind" and "exponent" attributes of unit1 are
identical to the kind and exponent attributes of unit2, C<false>
otherwise.

@see areIdentical()


=item Unit::removeScale

Manipulates the attributes of the Unit to express the unit with the 
value of the scale attribute reduced to zero.
For example, 1 millimetre can be expressed as a Unit with kind=@c
"metre" multiplier=C<"1"> scale=C<"-3"> exponent=C<"1">. It can also be
expressed as a Unit with kind=C<"metre">
multiplier=C<"0.001"> scale=C<"0"> exponent=C<"1">.
@param unit the Unit object to manipulate.
Returns integer value indicating success/failure of the function.  The
possible values returned by this function are:
@li @link OperationReturnValues_t#LIBSBML_OPERATION_SUCCESS LIBSBML_OPERATION_SUCCESS @endlink
@see convertToSI()
@see merge()


=item Unit::merge

Merges two Unit objects with the same "kind" attribute value into a
single Unit.
For example, the following,
C<ode>
<unit kind="metre" exponent="2"/>
<unit kind="metre" exponent="1"/>
@endcode
would be merged to become
C<ode>
<unit kind="metre" exponent="3"/>
@endcode

@param unit1 the first Unit object; the result of the operation is
left as a new version of this unit, modified in-place.
@param unit2 the second Unit object to merge with the first
@see convertToSI()
@see removeScale()


=item Unit::convertToSI

Returns a UnitDefinition object containing the given C<unit> converted
to the appropriate SI unit.
This method exists because some units can be expressed in terms of
others when the same physical dimension is involved.  For example, one
hertz is identical to 1&nbsp;sec<sup>-1</sup>, one litre is equivalent
to 1 cubic decametre, and so on.
@param unit the Unit object to convert to SI
Returns a UnitDefinition object containing the SI unit.
@see merge()


=item Unit::hasRequiredAttributes

Predicate returning C<true> if
all the required attributes for this Unit object
have been set.
@note The required attributes for a Unit object are:
@li "kind"
@li "exponent" (required in SBML Level&nbsp;3; optional in Level&nbsp;2)
@li "multiplier" (required in SBML Level&nbsp;3; optional in Level&nbsp;2)
@li "scale" (required in SBML Level&nbsp;3; optional in Level&nbsp;2)
Returns a boolean value indicating whether all the required
elements for this object have been defined.


=item Unit::Unit

Predicate returning C<true> if
all the required attributes for this Unit object
have been set.
@note The required attributes for a Unit object are:
@li "kind"
@li "exponent" (required in SBML Level&nbsp;3; optional in Level&nbsp;2)
@li "multiplier" (required in SBML Level&nbsp;3; optional in Level&nbsp;2)
@li "scale" (required in SBML Level&nbsp;3; optional in Level&nbsp;2)
Returns a boolean value indicating whether all the required

=head2 UnitDefinition

LibSBML implementation of SBML's UnitDefinition construct.
Units of measurement may be supplied in a number of contexts in an SBML
model.  The SBML unit definition facility uses two classes of objects,
UnitDefinition and Unit.  The approach to defining units in SBML is
compositional; for example, <em>meter second<sup> &ndash;2</sup></em> is
constructed by combining a Unit object representing <em>meter</em> with
another Unit object representing <em>second<sup> &ndash;2</sup></em>.
The combination is wrapped inside a UnitDefinition, which provides for
assigning an identifier and optional name to the combination.  The
identifier can then be referenced from elsewhere in a model.  Thus, the
UnitDefinition class is the container, and Unit instances are placed
inside UnitDefinition instances.
Two points are worth discussing in the context of SBML units.  First,
unit declarations in SBML models are \I<optional>.  The consequence of
this is that a model must be numerically self-consistent independently
of unit declarations, for the benefit of software tools that cannot
interpret or manipulate units.  Unit declarations in SBML are thus more
akin to a type of annotation; they can indicate intentions, and can be
used by model readers for checking the consistency of the model,
labeling simulation output, etc., but any transformations of values
implied by different units must be incorporated \I<explicitly> into a
model.

Second, the vast majority of situations that require new SBML unit
definitions involve simple multiplicative combinations of base units and
factors.  An example is <em>moles per litre per second</em>.  What
distinguishes these sorts of unit definitions from more complex ones is
that they may be expressed without the use of an additive offset from a
zero point.  The use of offsets complicates all unit definition systems,
yet in the domain of SBML, the real-life cases requiring offsets are few
(and in fact, to the best of our knowledge, only involve temperature).
Consequently, the SBML unit system has been consciously designed to
simplify implementation of unit support for the most common cases in
systems biology.  The cost of this simplification is to require units
with offsets to be handled explicitly by the modeler.
@section unitdef-summary Summary of the UnitDefinition construct
UnitDefinition has two attributes and one subelement.  The two
attributes are "id" and "name", and the subelement is ListOfUnits.
The required attribute "id" and optional attribute "name" are both
strings.  The "id" attribute is used to give the defined unit a unique
identifier by which other parts of an SBML model definition can refer to
it.  The "name" attribute is intended to be used for giving the unit
definition an optional human-readable name.  Please see the <a
href="#unitdef-id">next section</a> for information about the values
permitted for "id".
A UnitDefinition must contain exactly one ListOfUnits, and this list
must contain one or more Unit definitions; see the definitions of these
other object classes for more information about them.  The following
example illustrates a complete unit definition (when written in XML)
when they all the pieces are combined together.  This defines "mmls"
to be millimoles per litre per second.
C<ode>
<listOfUnitDefinitions>
<unitDefinition id="mmls">
<listOfUnits>
<unit kind="mole"   scale="-3"/>
<unit kind="litre"  exponent="-1"/>
<unit kind="second" exponent="-1"/>
</listOfUnits>
</unitDefinition>
</listOfUnitDefinitions>
@endcode
@section unitdef-id Special considerations for Unit object identifiers
The attribute "id" in UnitDefinition cannot be given simply any value,
and the precise details of the values permitted differ slightly between
Levels of SBML:

=over



=item

The "id" of a UnitDefinition must I<not> contain a value from the
list of SBML's predefined base unit names (i.e., the strings C<gram>, @c
litre, etc.).  In SBML Level&nbsp;3, this list consists of the
following:

@htmlinclude base-units2.html
This list of predefined base units is nearly identical in SBML
Level&nbsp;2 Version&nbsp;4, the exception being that Level&nbsp;2 does
not define C<avogadro>.  SBML Level&nbsp;2 Version&nbsp;1 (and only this
Level+Version combination) provides an additional predefined unit name,
C<Celsius>.  SBML Level&nbsp;1 Versions&nbsp;2&ndash;3 provide two more
additional predefined unit names, C<meter> and C<liter>.

=item

In SBML Level&nbsp;2 (all Versions), there is an additional set of
reserved identifiers: C<substance>, C<volume>, C<area>, C<length>, and
C<time>.  Using one of these values for the attribute "id" of a
UnitDefinition has the effect of redefining the model-wide default units
for the corresponding quantities.  The list of special unit names in
SBML Level&nbsp;2 is given in the table below:
@htmlinclude predefined-units.html
Also, SBML Level&nbsp;2 imposes two limitations on redefining the
predefined unit C<substance>, C<volume>, C<area>, C<length>, and @c
time: (1) The UnitDefinition of a predefined SBML unit can only contain
a single Unit object within it.  (2) The value of the "kind" attribute
in a Unit instance must be drawn from one of the values in the second
column of the table above.
The special unit names C<substance>, C<volume>, C<area>, C<length>, and
C<time> are not defined by SBML Level&nbsp;3, which uses a different
approach to setting model-wide inherited units.

=back



@section sbml-units-limits Further comments about SBML's unit definition system
The vast majority of modeling situations requiring new SBML unit
definitions involve simple multiplicative combinations of base units and
factors.  An example of this might be <em>moles per litre per
second</em>.  What distinguishes these sorts of simpler unit definitions
from more complex ones is that they may be expressed without the use of
an additive offset from a zero point.  The use of offsets complicates
all unit definition systems, yet in the domain of SBML the real-life
cases requiring offsets are few (and in fact, to the best of our
knowledge, only involve temperature).  Consequently, the SBML unit
system has been consciously designed in a way that attempts to simplify
implementation of unit support for the most common cases in systems
biology.

As of SBML Level&nbsp;2 Version&nbsp;2, Unit no longer has the
attribute called "offset" introduced in SBML Level&nbsp;2
Version&nbsp;1.  It turned out that the general case involving units
with offsets was incorrectly defined, and few (if any) developers even
attempted to support offset-based units in their software.  In the
development of Level&nbsp;2 Version&nbsp;2, a consensus among SBML
developers emerged that a fully generalized unit scheme is I<so>
confusing and complicated that it actually I<impedes> interoperability.
SBML Level&nbsp;2 Version&nbsp;2, Version&nbsp;3 and Version&nbsp;4 acknowledge this
reality by reducing and simplifying the unit system, specifically by
removing the "offset" attribute on Unit and C<Celsius> as a pre-defined
unit.

The following guidelines suggest methods for handling units that do
require the use of zero offsets for their definitions:

=over


=item

<em>Handling Celsius</em>.  A model in which certain quantities are
temperatures measured in degrees Celsius can be converted
straightforwardly to a model in which those temperatures are in
kelvin.  A software tool could do this by performing a straightforward
substitution using the following relationship: T<sub> kelvin</sub> =
T<sub> Celsius</sub> + 273.15.  In every mathematical formula of the
model where a quantity (call it I<x>) in degrees Celsius appears,
replace I<x> with x<sub> k</sub>+ 273.15, where x<sub> k</sub> is now
in kelvin.  An alternative approach would be to use a
FunctionDefinition to define a function encapsulating this
relationship above and then using that in the rest of the model as
needed.  Since Celsius is a commonly-used unit, software tools could
help users by providing users with the ability to express temperatures
in Celsius in the tools' interfaces, and making substitutions
automatically when writing out the SBML.

=item

<em>Other units requiring offsets</em>.  One approach to handling
other kinds of units is to use a FunctionDefinition to define a function
encapsulating the necessary mathematical relationship, then
substituting a call to this function wherever the original quantity
appeared in the model.  For example, here is a possible definition for
converting Fahrenheit to Celsius degrees:
C<ode>
<functionDefinition id="Fahrenheit_to_kelvin">
<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">
<lambda>
<bvar><ci> temp_in_fahrenheit </ci></bvar>
<apply>
<divide/>
<apply>
<plus/>
<ci> temp_in_fahrenheit </ci>
<cn> 459.67 </cn>
</apply>
<cn> 1.8 </cn>
</apply>
</lambda>
</math>
</functionDefinition>
@endcode


=item

An alternative approach not requiring the use of function definitions
is to use an AssignmentRule for each variable in Fahrenheit units.
The AssignmentRule could compute the conversion from Fahrenheit to
(say) kelvin, assign its value to a variable (in Kelvin units), and
then that variable could be used elsewhere in the model.

=item

Still another approach is to rewrite the mathematical formulas of a
model to directly incorporate the conversion formula wherever the
original quantity appeared.

=head2 ListOfUnitDefinitions

LibSBML implementation of SBML's ListOfUnitDefinitions construct.
The various ListOf___ classes in SBML are merely containers used for
organizing the main components of an SBML model.  All are derived from
the abstract class SBase, and inherit the various attributes and
subelements of SBase, such as "metaid" as and "annotation".  The
ListOf___ classes do not add any attributes of their own.
The relationship between the lists and the rest of an SBML model is
illustrated by the following (for SBML Level&nbsp;2 Version&nbsp;4):
@image html listof-illustration.jpg "ListOf___ elements in an SBML Model"
@image latex listof-illustration.jpg "ListOf___ elements in an SBML Model"
Readers may wonder about the motivations for using the ListOf___
containers.  A simpler approach in XML might be to place the components
all directly at the top level of the model definition.  We chose instead
to group them within XML elements named after ListOf<em>Classname</em>,
in part because we believe this helps organize the components and makes
visual reading of models in XML easier.  More importantly, the fact that
the container classes are derived from SBase means that software tools
can add information about the lists themselves into each list
container's "annotation".

=item UnitDefinition::areIdenticalSIUnits

Predicate returning C<true> if two
UnitDefinition objects are equivalent.
For the purposes of performing this comparison, two UnitDefinition
objects are considered equivalent when they contain I<equivalent>
list of Unit objects.  Unit objects are in turn considered equivalent
if they satisfy the predicate Unit::areEquivalent().  The predicate
tests a subset of the objects's attributes.
@param ud1 the first UnitDefinition object to compare
@param ud2 the second UnitDefinition object to compare
Returns C<true> if all the Unit objects in ud1 are equivalent
to the Unit objects in ud2, C<false> otherwise.

UnitDefinition object that expresses the product of the units of @p
ud1 and C<ud2>.
@param ud1 the first UnitDefinition object 
@param ud2 the second UnitDefinition object
Returns a UnitDefinition which represents the product of the 
units of the two argument UnitDefinitions.


=item UnitDefinition::printUnits

Expresses the given definition in a plain-text form.
For example, printUnits() applied to
C<ode>
<unitDefinition>
<listOfUnits>
<unit kind="metre" exponent="1"/>
<unit kind="second" exponent="-2"/>
</listOfUnits>
<unitDefinition>
@endcode
will return the string C<"metre (exponent = 1, multiplier = 1,
scale = 0) second (exponent = -2, multiplier = 1, scale = 0)">
or, if the optional parameter C<compact> is given the value C<true>,
the string C<"(1 metre)^1 (1 second)^-2">.  This method may
be useful for printing unit information to human users, or in
debugging software, or other situations.
@param ud the UnitDefinition object
@param compact boolean indicating whether the compact form
should be used (defaults to false)
Returns a string expressing the unit definition defined by the given

=head2 CompartmentType

LibSBML implementation of SBML's Level&nbsp;2's CompartmentType construct.
SBML Level&nbsp;2 Versions&nbsp;2&ndash;4 provide the <em>compartment
type</em> as a grouping construct that can be used to establish a
relationship between multiple Compartment objects.  A CompartmentType
object only has an identity, and this identity can only be used to
indicate that particular Compartment objects in the model belong to this
type.  This may be useful for conveying a modeling intention, such as
when a model contains many similar compartments, either by their
biological function or the reactions they carry.  Without a compartment
type construct, it would be impossible within SBML itself to indicate
that all of the compartments share an underlying conceptual relationship
because each SBML compartment must be given a unique and separate
identity.  Compartment types have no mathematical meaning in
SBML&mdash;they have no effect on a model's mathematical interpretation.
Simulators and other numerical analysis software may ignore
CompartmentType definitions and references to them in a model.
There is no mechanism in SBML Level 2 for representing hierarchies of
compartment types.  One CompartmentType instance cannot be the subtype
of another CompartmentType instance; SBML provides no means of defining
such relationships.
As with other major structures in SBML, CompartmentType has a mandatory
attribute, "id", used to give the compartment type an identifier.  The
identifier must be a text string conforming to the identifer syntax
permitted in SBML.  CompartmentType also has an optional "name"
attribute, of type C<string>.  The "id" and "name" must be used
according to the guidelines described in the SBML specification (e.g.,
Section 3.3 in the Level 2 Version 4 specification).
CompartmentType was introduced in SBML Level 2 Version 2.  It is not
available in SBML Level&nbsp;1 nor in Level&nbsp;3.

=head2 ListOfCompartmentTypes

LibSBML implementation of SBML's ListOfCompartmentTypes construct.
The various ListOf___ classes in SBML are merely containers used for
organizing the main components of an SBML model.  All are derived from
the abstract class SBase, and inherit the various attributes and
subelements of SBase, such as "metaid" as and "annotation".  The
ListOf___ classes do not add any attributes of their own.
The relationship between the lists and the rest of an SBML model is
illustrated by the following (for SBML Level&nbsp;2 Version&nbsp;4):
@image html listof-illustration.jpg "ListOf___ elements in an SBML Model"
@image latex listof-illustration.jpg "ListOf___ elements in an SBML Model"
Readers may wonder about the motivations for using the ListOf___
containers.  A simpler approach in XML might be to place the components
all directly at the top level of the model definition.  We chose instead
to group them within XML elements named after ListOf<em>Classname</em>,
in part because we believe this helps organize the components and makes
visual reading of models in XML easier.  More importantly, the fact that
the container classes are derived from SBase means that software tools
can add information about the lists themselves into each list
container's "annotation".

=item CompartmentType::CompartmentType

Creates a new CompartmentType using the given SBML C<level> and C<version>
values.

@param level an unsigned int, the SBML Level to assign to this CompartmentType
@param version an unsigned int, the SBML Version to assign to this
CompartmentType

@note Upon the addition of a CompartmentType object to an SBMLDocument
(e.g., using Model::addCompartmentType()), the SBML Level, SBML
Version and XML namespace of the document I<override> the
values used when creating the CompartmentType object via this
constructor.  This is necessary to ensure that an SBML document is a
consistent structure.  Nevertheless, the ability to supply the values
at the time of creation of a CompartmentType is an important aid to
producing valid SBML.  Knowledge of the intented SBML Level and
Version determine whether it is valid to assign a particular value to
an attribute, or whether it is valid to add an object to an existing
SBMLDocument.



=item CompartmentType::CompartmentType

Creates a new CompartmentType using the given SBMLNamespaces object
C<sbmlns>.
The SBMLNamespaces object encapsulates SBML Level/Version/namespaces
information.  It is used to communicate the SBML Level, Version, and
(in Level&nbsp;3) packages used in addition to SBML Level&nbsp;3 Core.
A common approach to using this class constructor is to create an
SBMLNamespaces object somewhere in a program, once, then pass it to
object constructors such as this one when needed.
It is worth emphasizing that although this constructor does not take
an identifier argument, in SBML Level&nbsp;2 and beyond, the "id"
(identifier) attribute of a CompartmentType is required to have a value.
Thus, callers are cautioned to assign a value after calling this
constructor.  Setting the identifier can be accomplished using the
method @if clike setId() @endif@if java setId(String id) @endif.
@param sbmlns an SBMLNamespaces object.
@note Upon the addition of a CompartmentType object to an SBMLDocument
(e.g., using Model::addCompartmentType()), the SBML XML namespace of
the document I<overrides> the value used when creating the

=head2 SpeciesType

LibSBML implementation of SBML Level&nbsp;2's SpeciesType construct.
The term I<species> I<type> refers to reacting entities independent of
location.  These include simple ions (e.g., protons, calcium), simple
molecules (e.g., glucose, ATP), large molecules (e.g., RNA,
polysaccharides, and proteins), and others.
SBML Level&nbsp;2 Versions&nbsp;2&ndash;4 provide an explicit
SpeciesType class of object to enable Species objects of the same type
to be related together.  SpeciesType is a conceptual construct; the
existence of SpeciesType objects in a model has no effect on the model's
numerical interpretation.  Except for the requirement for uniqueness of
species/species type combinations located in compartments, simulators
and other numerical analysis software may ignore SpeciesType definitions
and references to them in a model.
There is no mechanism in SBML Level 2 for representing hierarchies of
species types.  One SpeciesType object cannot be the subtype of another
SpeciesType object; SBML provides no means of defining such
relationships.

As with other major structures in SBML, SpeciesType has a mandatory
attribute, "id", used to give the species type an identifier.  The
identifier must be a text string conforming to the identifer syntax
permitted in SBML.  SpeciesType also has an optional "name" attribute,
of type C<string>.  The "id" and "name" must be used according to the
guidelines described in the SBML specification (e.g., Section 3.3 in
the Level&nbsp;2 Version&nbsp;4 specification).
SpeciesType was introduced in SBML Level 2 Version 2.  It is not
available in SBML Level&nbsp;1 nor in Level&nbsp;3.

=head2 ListOfSpeciesTypes

LibSBML implementation of SBML's ListOfSpeciesTypes construct.
The various ListOf___ classes in SBML are merely containers used for
organizing the main components of an SBML model.  All are derived from
the abstract class SBase, and inherit the various attributes and
subelements of SBase, such as "metaid" as and "annotation".  The
ListOf___ classes do not add any attributes of their own.
The relationship between the lists and the rest of an SBML model is
illustrated by the following (for SBML Level&nbsp;2 Version&nbsp;4):
@image html listof-illustration.jpg "ListOf___ elements in an SBML Model"
@image latex listof-illustration.jpg "ListOf___ elements in an SBML Model"
Readers may wonder about the motivations for using the ListOf___
containers.  A simpler approach in XML might be to place the components
all directly at the top level of the model definition.  We chose instead
to group them within XML elements named after ListOf<em>Classname</em>,
in part because we believe this helps organize the components and makes
visual reading of models in XML easier.  More importantly, the fact that
the container classes are derived from SBase means that software tools
can add information about the lists themselves into each list
container's "annotation".

=item SpeciesType::SpeciesType

Creates a new SpeciesType using the given SBML C<level> and C<version>
values.

@param level an unsigned int, the SBML Level to assign to this SpeciesType
@param version an unsigned int, the SBML Version to assign to this
SpeciesType

@note Upon the addition of a SpeciesType object to an SBMLDocument
(e.g., using Model::addSpeciesType()), the SBML Level, SBML Version
and XML namespace of the document I<override> the values used
when creating the SpeciesType object via this constructor.  This is
necessary to ensure that an SBML document is a consistent structure.
Nevertheless, the ability to supply the values at the time of creation
of a SpeciesType is an important aid to producing valid SBML.
Knowledge of the intented SBML Level and Version determine whether it
is valid to assign a particular value to an attribute, or whether it
is valid to add an object to an existing SBMLDocument.


=item SpeciesType::SpeciesType

Creates a new SpeciesType using the given SBMLNamespaces object
C<sbmlns>.
The SBMLNamespaces object encapsulates SBML Level/Version/namespaces
information.  It is used to communicate the SBML Level, Version, and
(in Level&nbsp;3) packages used in addition to SBML Level&nbsp;3 Core.
A common approach to using this class constructor is to create an
SBMLNamespaces object somewhere in a program, once, then pass it to
object constructors such as this one when needed.
It is worth emphasizing that although this constructor does not take
an identifier argument, in SBML Level&nbsp;2 and beyond, the "id"
(identifier) attribute of a SpeciesType object is required to have a value.
Thus, callers are cautioned to assign a value after calling this
constructor.  Setting the identifier can be accomplished using the
method @if clike SBase::setId() @endif@if java SBase::setId(String id) @endif.
@param sbmlns an SBMLNamespaces object.
@note Upon the addition of a SpeciesType object to an SBMLDocument

=head2 Compartment

LibSBML implementation of SBML's Compartment construct.
A compartment in SBML represents a bounded space in which species are
located.  Compartments do not necessarily have to correspond to actual
structures inside or outside of a biological cell.
It is important to note that although compartments are optional in the
overall definition of Model, every species in an SBML model must be
located in a compartment.  This in turn means that if a model defines
any species, the model must also define at least one compartment.  The
reason is simply that species represent physical things, and therefore
must exist I<somewhere>.  Compartments represent the I<somewhere>.
Compartment has one required attribute, "id", to give the compartment a
unique identifier by which other parts of an SBML model definition can
refer to it.  A compartment can also have an optional "name" attribute
of type C<string>.  Identifiers and names must be used according to the
guidelines described in the SBML specifications.
Compartment also has an optional attribute "spatialDimensions" that is
used to indicate the number of spatial dimensions possessed by the
compartment.  Most modeling scenarios involve compartments with integer
values of "spatialDimensions" of C<3> (i.e., a three-dimensional
compartment, which is to say, a volume), or 2 (a two-dimensional
compartment, a surface), or C<1> (a one-dimensional compartment, a
line).  In SBML Level&nbsp;3, the type of this attribute is C<double>,
there are no restrictions on the permitted values of the
"spatialDimensions" attribute, and there are no default values.  In SBML
Level&nbsp;2, the value must be a positive C<integer>, and the default
value is C<3>; the permissible values in SBML Level&nbsp;2 are C<3>, @c
2, C<1>, and C<0> (for a point).
Another optional attribute on Compartment is "size", representing the
I<initial> total size of that compartment in the model.  The "size"
attribute must be a floating-point value and may represent a volume (if
the compartment is a three-dimensional one), or an area (if the
compartment is two-dimensional), or a length (if the compartment is
one-dimensional).  There is no default value of compartment size in SBML
Level&nbsp;2 or Level&nbsp;3.  In particular, a missing "size" value
<em>does not imply that the compartment size is 1</em>.  (This is unlike
the definition of compartment "volume" in SBML Level&nbsp;1.)  When the
compartment's "spatialDimensions" attribute does not have a value of @c
0, a missing value of "size" for a given compartment signifies that the
value either is unknown, or to be obtained from an external source, or
determined by an InitialAssignment, AssignmentRule, AlgebraicRule or
RateRule elsewhere in the model.  In SBML Level&nbsp;2, there are
additional special requirements on the values of "size"; we discuss them
in a <a href="#comp-l2">separate section below</a>.
The units associated with a compartment's "size" attribute value may be
set using the optional attribute "units".  The rules for setting and
using compartment size units differ between SBML Level&nbsp;2 and
Level&nbsp;3, and are discussed separately below.
Finally, the optional Compartment attribute named "constant" is used to
indicate whether the compartment's size stays constant after simulation
begins.  A value of C<true> indicates the compartment's "size" cannot be
changed by any other construct except InitialAssignment; a value of @c
false indicates the compartment's "size" can be changed by other
constructs in SBML.  In SBML Level&nbsp;2, there is an additional
explicit restriction that if "spatialDimensions"=C<"0">, the value
cannot be changed by InitialAssignment either.  Further, in
Level&nbsp;2, "constant" has a default value of C<true>.  In SBML
Level&nbsp;3, there is no default value for the "constant" attribute.
@section comp-l2 Additional considerations in SBML Level&nbsp;2
In SBML Level&nbsp;2, the default units of compartment size, and the
kinds of units allowed as values of the attribute "units", interact with
the number of spatial dimensions of the compartment.  The value of the
"units" attribute of a Compartment object must be one of the base units
(see Unit), or the predefined unit identifiers C<volume>, C<area>, @c
length or C<dimensionless>, or a new unit defined by a UnitDefinition
object in the enclosing Model, subject to the restrictions detailed in
the following table:
@htmlinclude compartment-size-restrictions.html 
In SBML Level&nbsp;2, the units of the compartment size, as defined by the
"units" attribute or (if "units" is not set) the default value listed in
the table above, are used in the following ways when the compartment has
a "spatialDimensions" value greater than C<0>:

=over


=item

The value of the "units" attribute is used as the units of the
compartment identifier when the identifier appears as a numerical
quantity in a mathematical formula expressed in MathML.

=item

The C<math> element of an AssignmentRule or InitialAssignment
referring to this compartment must have identical units.

=item

In RateRule objects that set the rate of change of the compartment's
size, the units of the rule's C<math> element must be identical to the
compartment's "units" attribute divided by the default I<time> units.
(In other words, the units for the rate of change of compartment size
are <em>compartment size</em>/<em>time</em> units.

=item

When a Species is to be treated in terms of concentrations or
density, the units of the spatial size portion of the concentration
value (i.e., the denominator in the units formula I<substance>/@em
size) are those indicated by the value of the "units" attribute on the
compartment in which the species is located.

=back


Compartments with "spatialDimensions"=C<0> require special treatment in
this framework.  As implied above, the "size" attribute must not have a
value on an SBML Level&nbsp;2 Compartment object if the
"spatialDimensions" attribute has a value of C<0>.  An additional
related restriction is that the "constant" attribute must default to or
be set to C<true> if the value of the "spatialDimensions" attribute is
C<0>, because a zero-dimensional compartment cannot ever have a size.
If a compartment has no size or dimensional units, how should such a
compartment's identifier be interpreted when it appears in mathematical
formulas?  The answer is that such a compartment's identifier should not
appear in mathematical formulas in the first place&mdash;it has no
value, and its value cannot change.  Note also that a zero-dimensional
compartment is a point, and species located at points can only be
described in terms of amounts, not spatially-dependent measures such as
concentration.  Since SBML KineticLaw formulas are already in terms of
I<substance>/I<time> and not (say) I<concentration>/I<time>, volume
or other factors in principle are not needed for species located in
zero-dimensional compartments.
Finally, in SBML Level&nbsp;2 Versions 2&ndash;4, each compartment in a
model may optionally be designated as belonging to a particular
compartment I<type>.  The optional attribute "compartmentType" is used
identify the compartment type represented by the Compartment structure.
The "compartmentType" attribute's value must be the identifier of a
CompartmentType instance defined in the model.  If the "compartmentType"
attribute is not present on a particular compartment definition, a
unique virtual compartment type is assumed for that compartment, and no
other compartment can belong to that compartment type.  The values of
"compartmentType" attributes on compartments have no effect on the
numerical interpretation of a model.  Simulators and other numerical
analysis software may ignore "compartmentType" attributes.  The
"compartmentType" attribute and the CompartmentType class of objects are
not present in SBML Level&nbsp;3 Core nor in SBML Level&nbsp;1.
@section comp-l3 Additional considerations in SBML Level&nbsp;3
One difference between SBML Level&nbsp;3 and lower Levels of SBML is
that there are no restrictions on the permissible values of the
"spatialDimensions" attribute, and there is no default value defined for
the attribute.  The value of "spatialDimensions" does not have to be an
integer, either; this is to allow for the possibility of representing
structures with fractal dimensions.
The number of spatial dimensions possessed by a compartment cannot enter
into mathematical formulas, and therefore cannot directly alter the
numerical interpretation of a model.  However, the value of
"spatialDimensions" I<does> affect the interpretation of the units
associated with a compartment's size.  Specifically, the value of
"spatialDimensions" is used to select among the Model attributes
"volumeUnits", "areaUnits" and "lengthUnits" when a Compartment object
does not define a value for its "units" attribute.
The "units" attribute may be left unspecified for a given compartment in
a model; in that case, the compartment inherits the unit of measurement
specified by one of the attributes on the enclosing Model object
instance.  The applicable attribute on Model depends on the value of the
compartment's "spatialDimensions" attribute; the relationship is shown
in the table below.  If the Model object does not define the relevant
attribute ("volumeUnits", "areaUnits" or "lengthUnits") for a given
"spatialDimensions" value, the unit associated with that Compartment
object's size is undefined.  If I<both> "spatialDimensions" and "units"
are left unset on a given Compartment object instance, then no unit can
be chosen from among the Model's "volumeUnits", "areaUnits" or
"lengthUnits" attributes (even if the Model instance provides values for
those attributes), because there is no basis to select between them and
there is no default value of "spatialDimensions".  Leaving the units of
compartments' sizes undefined in an SBML model does not render the model
invalid; however, as a matter of best practice, we strongly recommend
that all models specify the units of measurement for all compartment
sizes.

@htmlinclude compartment-size-recommendations.html
The unit of measurement associated with a compartment's size, as defined
by the "units" attribute or (if "units" is not set) the inherited value
from Model according to the table above, is used in the following ways:

=over



=item

When the identifier of the compartment appears as a numerical
quantity in a mathematical formula expressed in MathML, it represents
the size of the compartment, and the unit associated with the size is
the value of the "units" attribute.

=item

When a Species is to be treated in terms of concentrations or
density, the unit associated with the spatial size portion of the
concentration value (i.e., the denominator in the formula
<em>amount</em>/<em>size</em>) is specified by the value of the "units"
attribute on the compartment in which the species is located.

=item

The "math" elements of AssignmentRule, InitialAssignment and
EventAssignment objects setting the value of the compartment size
should all have the same units as the unit associated with the
compartment's size.

=item

In a RateRule object that defines a rate of change for a
compartment's size, the unit of the rule's "math" element should be
identical to the compartment's "units" attribute divided by the
model-wide unit of <em>time</em>.  (In other words, {<em>unit of
compartment size</em>}/{<em>unit of time</em>}.)

=back



@section comp-other Other aspects of Compartment
In SBML Level&nbsp;1 and Level&nbsp;2, Compartment has an optional
attribute named "outside", whose value can be the identifier of another
Compartment object defined in the enclosing Model object.  Doing so
means that the other compartment contains it or is outside of it.  This
enables the representation of simple topological relationships between
compartments, for those simulation systems that can make use of the
information (e.g., for drawing simple diagrams of compartments).  It is
worth noting that in SBML, there is no relationship between compartment
sizes when compartment positioning is expressed using the "outside"
attribute.  The size of a given compartment does not in any sense
include the sizes of other compartments having it as the value of their
"outside" attributes.  In other words, if a compartment I<B> has the
identifier of compartment I<A> as its "outside" attribute value, the
size of I<A> does not include the size of I<B>.  The compartment sizes
are separate.
In Level&nbsp;2, there are two restrictions on the "outside" attribute.
First, because a compartment with "spatialDimensions" of C<0> has no
size, such a compartment cannot act as the container of any other
compartment I<except> compartments that I<also> have
"spatialDimensions" values of C<0>.  Second, the directed graph formed
by representing Compartment structures as vertexes and the "outside"
attribute values as edges must be acyclic.  The latter condition is
imposed to prevent a compartment from being contained inside itself.  In
the absence of a value for "outside", compartment definitions in SBML
Level&nbsp;2 do not have any implied spatial relationships between each
other.

=head2 ListOfCompartments

LibSBML implementation of SBML Level&nbsp;2's ListOfCompartments construct.
The various ListOf___ classes in SBML are merely containers used for
organizing the main components of an SBML model.  All are derived from
the abstract class SBase, and inherit the various attributes and
subelements of SBase, such as "metaid" as and "annotation".  The
ListOf___ classes do not add any attributes of their own.
The relationship between the lists and the rest of an SBML model is
illustrated by the following (for SBML Level&nbsp;2 Version&nbsp;4):
@image html listof-illustration.jpg "ListOf___ elements in an SBML Model"
@image latex listof-illustration.jpg "ListOf___ elements in an SBML Model"
Readers may wonder about the motivations for using the ListOf___
containers.  A simpler approach in XML might be to place the components
all directly at the top level of the model definition.  We chose instead
to group them within XML elements named after ListOf<em>Classname</em>,
in part because we believe this helps organize the components and makes
visual reading of models in XML easier.  More importantly, the fact that
the container classes are derived from SBase means that software tools
can add information about the lists themselves into each list
container's "annotation".

=item Compartment::Compartment

Creates a new Compartment using the given SBML C<level> and C<version>
values.

@param level an unsigned int, the SBML Level to assign to this Compartment
@param version an unsigned int, the SBML Version to assign to this
Compartment

@note Upon the addition of a Compartment object to an SBMLDocument
(e.g., using Model::addCompartment()), the SBML Level, SBML Version
and XML namespace of the document I<override> the values used
when creating the Compartment object via this constructor.  This is
necessary to ensure that an SBML document is a consistent structure.
Nevertheless, the ability to supply the values at the time of creation
of a Compartment is an important aid to producing valid SBML.
Knowledge of the intented SBML Level and Version determine whether it
is valid to assign a particular value to an attribute, or whether it
is valid to add an object to an existing SBMLDocument.


=item Compartment::Compartment

Creates a new Compartment using the given SBMLNamespaces object 
C<sbmlns>.
The SBMLNamespaces object encapsulates SBML Level/Version/namespaces
information.  It is used to communicate the SBML Level, Version, and
(in Level&nbsp;3) packages used in addition to SBML Level&nbsp;3 Core.
A common approach to using this class constructor is to create an
SBMLNamespaces object somewhere in a program, once, then pass it to
object constructors such as this one when needed.
It is worth emphasizing that although this constructor does not take
an identifier argument, in SBML Level&nbsp;2 and beyond, the "id"
(identifier) attribute of a Compartment is required to have a value.
Thus, callers are cautioned to assign a value after calling this
constructor.  Setting the identifier can be accomplished using the
method @if clike setId() @endif@if java setId(String id) @endif.
@param sbmlns an SBMLNamespaces object.
@note Upon the addition of a Compartment object to an SBMLDocument
(e.g., using Model::addCompartment()), the SBML XML namespace of the
document I<overrides> the value used when creating the Compartment
object via this constructor.  This is necessary to ensure that an SBML

=item Compartment::Compartment

Copy constructor; creates a copy of a Compartment.
@param orig the Compartment instance to copy.


=item Compartment::accept

Accepts the given SBMLVisitor for this instance of Compartment.
@param v the SBMLVisitor instance to be used.
Returns the result of calling C<v.visit()>, which indicates
whether the Visitor would like to visit the next Compartment in the
list of compartments within which this Compartment is embedded (i.e.,
the ListOfCompartments in the parent Model).


=item Compartment::clone

Creates and returns a deep copy of this Compartment object.
Returns a (deep) copy of this Compartment.


=item Compartment::initDefaults

Initializes the fields of this Compartment object to "typical" default
values.

The SBML Compartment component has slightly different aspects and
default attribute values in different SBML Levels and Versions.
This method sets the values to certain common defaults, based
mostly on what they are in SBML Level&nbsp;2.  Specifically:

=over


=item

Sets attribute "spatialDimensions" to C<3>

=item

Sets attribute "constant" to C<true>

=item

(Applies to Level&nbsp;1 models only) Sets attribute "volume" to C<1>.0

Get the number of spatial dimensions of this Compartment object.
@note In SBML Level&nbsp;3, the data type of the "spatialDimensions"
attribute is C<double>, whereas in Level&nbsp;2, it is C<integer>.
LibSBML provides a separate method for obtaining the value as a double,
for models where it is relevant.
Returns the value of the "spatialDimensions" attribute of this
Compartment as an unsigned integer
@see getSpatialDimensionsAsDouble()


=item Compartment::getSpatialDimensionsAsDouble

Get the number of spatial dimensions of this Compartment object
as a double.
@note In SBML Level&nbsp;3, the data type of the "spatialDimensions"
attribute is C<double>, whereas in Level&nbsp;2, it is C<integer>.  To
avoid backward compatibility issues, libSBML provides a separate
method for obtaining the value as a double, for models where it is
relevant.

Returns the value of the "spatialDimensions" attribute of this
Compartment as a double, or C<NaN> if this model is not in SBML
Level&nbsp;3 format.
@see getSpatialDimensions()


=item Compartment::getSize

Get the size of this Compartment.
This method is identical to getVolume().  In SBML Level&nbsp;1,
compartments are always three-dimensional constructs and only have
volumes, whereas in SBML Level&nbsp;2, compartments may be other than
three-dimensional and therefore the "volume" attribute is named "size"
in Level&nbsp;2.  LibSBML provides both getSize() and getVolume() for
easier compatibility between SBML Levels.
Returns the value of the "size" attribute ("volume" in Level&nbsp;1) of
this Compartment as a float-point number.
@see isSetSize()
@see getVolume()


=item Compartment::getVolume

Get the volume of this Compartment.
This method is identical to getSize().  In SBML Level&nbsp;1, compartments
are always three-dimensional constructs and only have volumes, whereas
in SBML Level&nbsp;2, compartments may be other than three-dimensional and
therefore the "volume" attribute is named "size" in Level&nbsp;2.  LibSBML
provides both getSize() and getVolume() for easier compatibility
between SBML Levels.
Returns the value of the "volume" attribute ("size" in Level&nbsp;2) of
this Compartment, as a floating-point number.
@note The attribute "volume" only exists by that name in SBML
Level&nbsp;1.  In Level&nbsp;2 and above, the equivalent attribute is
named "size".

=item Compartment::getUnits

Get the units of this compartment's size.
The value of an SBML compartment's "units" attribute establishes the
unit of measurement associated with the compartment's size.
Returns the value of the "units" attribute of this Compartment, as a
string.  An empty string indicates that no units have been assigned to
the value of the size.

=item Compartment::isSetSize

Predicate returning C<true> if this
Compartment's "size" attribute has been set.
This method is similar but not identical to isSetVolume().  The latter
should be used in the context of SBML Level&nbsp;1 models instead of
isSetSize() because isSetVolume() performs extra processing to take
into account the difference in default values between SBML Levels 1
and 2.
Returns C<true> if the "size" attribute ("volume" in Level&nbsp;2) of
this Compartment has been set, C<false> otherwise.

=item Compartment::getDerivedUnitDefinition

Constructs and returns a UnitDefinition that corresponds to the units
of this Compartment's designated size.
Compartments in SBML have an attribute ("units") for declaring the
units of measurement intended for the value of the compartment's size.
In the absence of a value given for this attribute, the units are
inherited from values either defined on the enclosing Model (in SBML
Level&nbsp;3) or in defaults (in SBML Level&nbsp;2).  This method
returns a UnitDefinition object based on how this compartment's units

=item Compartment::getDerivedUnitDefinition

Constructs and returns a UnitDefinition that corresponds to the units
of this Compartment's designated size.
Compartments in SBML have an attribute ("units") for declaring the
units of measurement intended for the value of the compartment's size.
In the absence of a value given for this attribute, the units are
inherited from values either defined on the enclosing Model (in SBML
Level&nbsp;3) or in defaults (in SBML Level&nbsp;2).  This method
returns a UnitDefinition object based on how this compartment's units
are interpreted according to the relevant SBML guidelines, or it
returns C<NULL> if no units have been declared and no defaults are
defined by the relevant SBML specification.
Note that unit declarations for Compartment objects are specified in

=head2 Species

LibSBML implementation of SBML's Species construct.
A I<species> in SBML refers to a pool of entities that (a) are
considered indistinguishable from each other for the purposes of the
model, (b) participate in reactions, and (c) are located in a specific
I<compartment>.  The SBML Species object class is intended to represent
these pools.
As with other major constructs in SBML, Species has a mandatory
attribute, "id", used to give the species type an identifier in the
model.  The identifier must be a text string conforming to the identifer
syntax permitted in SBML.  Species also has an optional "name"
attribute, of type C<string>.  The "id" and "name" must be used
according to the guidelines described in the SBML specifications.
The required attribute "compartment" is used to identify the compartment
in which the species is located.  The attribute's value must be the
identifier of an existing Compartment object.  It is important to note
that there is no default value for the "compartment" attribute on
Species; every species in an SBML model must be assigned a compartment
I<explicitly>.  (This also implies that every model with one or more
Species objects must define at least one Compartment object.)
@section species-amounts The initial amount and concentration of a species
The optional attributes "initialAmount" and "initialConcentration", both
having a data type of C<double>, can be used to set the I<initial>
quantity of the species in the compartment where the species is located.
These attributes are mutually exclusive; i.e., <em>only one</em> can
have a value on any given instance of a Species object.  Missing
"initialAmount" and "initialConcentration" values implies that their
values either are unknown, or to be obtained from an external source, or
determined by an InitialAssignment or other SBML construct elsewhere in
the model.
A species' initial quantity in SBML is set by the "initialAmount" or
"initialConcentration" attribute exactly once.  If the "constant"
attribute is C<true>, then the value of the species' quantity is fixed
and cannot be changed except by an InitialAssignment.  These methods
differ in that the "initialAmount" and "initialConcentration" attributes
can only be used to set the species quantity to a literal floating-point
number, whereas the use of an InitialAssignment object allows the value
to be set using an arbitrary mathematical expression (which, thanks to
MathML's expressiveness, may evaluate to a rational number).  If the
species' "constant" attribute is C<false>, the species' quantity value
may be overridden by an InitialAssignment or changed by AssignmentRule
or AlgebraicRule, and in addition, for <em>t &gt; 0</em>, it may also be
changed by a RateRule, Event objects, and as a result of being a
reactant or product in one or more Reaction objects.  (However, some
constructs are mutually exclusive; see the SBML specifications for the
precise details.)  It is not an error to define "initialAmount" or
"initialConcentration" on a species and also redefine the value using an
InitialAssignment, but the "initialAmount" or "initialConcentration"
setting in that case is ignored.  The SBML specifications provide
additional information about the semantics of assignments, rules and
values for simulation time <em>t</em> \f$\leq\f$ <em>0</em>.
SBML Level&nbsp;2 additionally stipulates that in cases where a species'
compartment has a "spatialDimensions" value of C<0> (zero), the species
cannot have a value for "initialConcentration" because the concepts of
concentration and density break down when a container has zero
dimensions.

@section species-units The units of a species' amount or concentration
When the attribute "initialAmount" is set, the unit of measurement
associated with the value of "initialAmount" is specified by the Species
attribute "substanceUnits".  When the "initialConcentration" attribute
is set, the unit of measurement associated with this concentration value
is {<em>unit of amount</em>} divided by {<em>unit of size</em>}, where
the {<em>unit of amount</em>} is specified by the Species
"substanceUnits" attribute, and the {<em>unit of size</em>} is specified
by the "units" attribute of the Compartment object in which the species
is located.  Note that in either case, a unit of <em>amount</em> is
involved and determined by the "substanceUnits" attribute.  Note
<strong>these two attributes alone do not determine the units of the
species when the species identifier appears in a mathematical
expression</strong>; <em>that</em> aspect is determined by the attribute
"hasOnlySubstanceUnits" discussed below.
In SBML Level&nbsp;3, if the "substanceUnits" attribute is not set on a
given Species object instance, then the unit of <em>amount</em> for that
species is inherited from the "substanceUnits" attribute on the
enclosing Model object instance.  If that attribute on Model is not set
either, then the unit associated with the species' quantity is
undefined.

In SBML Level&nbsp;2, if the "substanceUnits" attribute is not set on a
given Species object instance, then the unit of <em>amount</em> for that
species is taken from the predefined SBML unit identifier @c
"substance".  The value assigned to "substanceUnits" must be chosen from
one of the following possibilities: one of the base unit identifiers
defined in SBML, the built-in unit identifier C<"substance">, or the
identifier of a new unit defined in the list of unit definitions in the
enclosing Model object.  The chosen units for "substanceUnits" must be
be C<"dimensionless">, C<"mole">, C<"item">, C<"kilogram">, C<"gram">,
or units derived from these.
As noted at the beginning of this section, simply setting
"initialAmount" or "initialConcentration" alone does I<not> determine
whether a species identifier represents an amount or a concentration
when it appears elsewhere in an SBML model.  The role of the attribute
"hasOnlySubstanceUnits" is to indicate whether the units of the species,
when the species identifier appears in mathematical formulas, are
intended to be concentration or amount.  The attribute takes on a
boolean value.  In SBML Level&nbsp;3, the attribute has no default value
and must always be set in a model; in SBML Level&nbsp;2, it has a
default value of C<false>.
The <em>units of the species</em> are used in the following ways:

=over



=item

When the species' identifier appears in a MathML formula, it
represents the species' quantity, and the unit of measurement associated
with the quantity is as described above.

=item

The "math" elements of AssignmentRule, InitialAssignment and
EventAssignment objects referring to this species should all have the
same units as the unit of measurement associated with the species
quantity.


=item

In a RateRule object that defines the rate of change of the
species' quantity, the unit associated with the rule's "math" element
should be equal to the unit of the species' quantity divided by the
model-wide unit of <em>time</em>; in other words, {<em>unit of species
quantity</em>}/{<em>unit of time</em>}.

=back



@section species-constant The "constant" and "boundaryCondition" attributes
The Species object class has two boolean attributes named "constant" and
"boundaryCondition", used to indicate whether and how the quantity of
that species can vary during a simulation.  In SBML Level&nbsp;2 they
are optional; in SBML Level&nbsp;3 they are mandatory.  The following
table shows how to interpret the combined values of these attributes.
@htmlinclude species-boundarycondition.html
By default, when a species is a product or reactant of one or more
reactions, its quantity is determined by those reactions.  In SBML, it
is possible to indicate that a given species' quantity is <em>not</em>
determined by the set of reactions even when that species occurs as a
product or reactant; i.e., the species is on the <em>boundary</em> of
the reaction system, and its quantity is not determined by the
reactions.  The boolean attribute "boundaryCondition" can be used to
indicate this.  A value of C<false> indicates that the species I<is>
part of the reaction system.  In SBML Level&nbsp;2, the attribute has a
default value of C<false>, while in SBML Level&nbsp;3, it has no
default.

The "constant" attribute indicates whether the species' quantity can be
changed at all, regardless of whether by reactions, rules, or constructs
other than InitialAssignment.  A value of C<false> indicates that the
species' quantity can be changed.  (This is also a common value because
the purpose of most simulations is precisely to calculate changes in
species quantities.)  In SBML Level&nbsp;2, the attribute has a default
value of C<false>, while in SBML Level&nbsp;3, it has no default.  Note
that the initial quantity of a species can be set by an
InitialAssignment irrespective of the value of the "constant" attribute.
In practice, a "boundaryCondition" value of C<true> means a differential
equation derived from the reaction definitions should not be generated
for the species.  However, the species' quantity may still be changed by
AssignmentRule, RateRule, AlgebraicRule, Event, and InitialAssignment
constructs if its "constant" attribute is C<false>.  Conversely, if the
species' "constant" attribute is C<true>, then its value cannot be
changed by anything except InitialAssignment.
A species having "boundaryCondition"=C<false> and "constant"=C<false>
can appear as a product and/or reactant of one or more reactions in the
model.  If the species is a reactant or product of a reaction, it must
I<not> also appear as the target of any AssignmentRule or RateRule
object in the model.  If instead the species has "boundaryCondition"=@c
false and "constant"=C<true>, then it cannot appear as a reactant or
product, or as the target of any AssignmentRule, RateRule or
EventAssignment object in the model.
@section species-l2-convfactor The conversionFactor attribute in SBML Level&nbsp;3
In SBML Level&nbsp;3, Species has an additional optional attribute,
"conversionFactor", that defines a conversion factor that applies to a
particular species.  The value must be the identifier of a Parameter
object instance defined in the model.  That Parameter object must be a
constant, meaning its "constant" attribute must be set to C<true>.
If a given Species object definition defines a value for its
"conversionFactor" attribute, it takes precedence over any factor
defined by the Model object's "conversionFactor" attribute.
The unit of measurement associated with a species' quantity can be
different from the unit of extent of reactions in the model.  SBML
Level&nbsp;3 avoids implicit unit conversions by providing an explicit
way to indicate any unit conversion that might be required.  The use of
a conversion factor in computing the effects of reactions on a species'
quantity is explained in detail in the SBML Level&nbsp;3 specification
document.  Because the value of the "conversionFactor" attribute is the
identifier of a Parameter object, and because parameters can have units
attached to them, the transformation from reaction extent units to
species units can be completely specified using this approach.
Note that the unit conversion factor is <strong>only applied when
calculating the effect of a reaction on a species</strong>.  It is not
used in any rules or other SBML constructs that affect the species, and
it is also not used when the value of the species is referenced in a
mathematical expression.
@section species-l2-type The speciesType attribute in SBML Level&nbsp;2 Versions&nbsp;2&ndash;4
In SBML Level&nbsp;2 Versions&nbsp;2&ndash;4, each species in a model
may optionally be designated as belonging to a particular species type.
The optional attribute "speciesType" is used to identify the species
type of the chemical entities that make up the pool represented by the
Species objects.  The attribute's value must be the identifier of an
existing SpeciesType object in the model.  If the "speciesType"
attribute is not present on a particular species definition, it means
the pool contains chemical entities of a type unique to that pool; in
effect, a virtual species type is assumed for that species, and no other
species can belong to that species type.  The value of "speciesType"
attributes on species have no effect on the numerical interpretation of
a model; simulators and other numerical analysis software may ignore
"speciesType" attributes.
There can be only one species of a given species type in any given
compartment of a model.  More specifically, for all Species objects
having a value for the "speciesType" attribute, the pair
<center>
("speciesType" attribute value, "compartment" attribute value)
</center>

must be unique across the set of all Species object in a model.
@section species-other The spatialSizeUnits attribute in SBML Level&nbsp;2 Versions&nbsp;1&ndash;2
In versions of SBML Level&nbsp;2 before Version&nbsp;3, the class
Species included an attribute called "spatialSizeUnits", which allowed
explicitly setting the units of size for initial concentration.  LibSBML
retains this attribute for compatibility with older definitions of
Level&nbsp;2, but its use is strongly discouraged because many software
tools do no properly interpret this unit declaration and it is
incompatible with all SBML specifications after Level&nbsp;2
Version&nbsp;3.


@section species-math Additional considerations for interpreting the numerical value of a species
Species are unique in SBML in that they have a kind of duality: a
species identifier may stand for either substance amount (meaning, a
count of the number of individual entities) or a concentration or
density (meaning, amount divided by a compartment size).  The previous
sections explain the meaning of a species identifier when it is
referenced in a mathematical formula or in rules or other SBML
constructs; however, it remains to specify what happens to a species
when the compartment in which it is located changes in size.
When a species definition has a "hasOnlySubstanceUnits" attribute value
of C<false> and the size of the compartment in which the species is
located changes, the default in SBML is to assume that it is the
concentration that must be updated to account for the size change.  This
follows from the principle that, all other things held constant, if a
compartment simply changes in size, the size change does not in itself
cause an increase or decrease in the number of entities of any species
in that compartment.  In a sense, the default is that the I<amount> of
a species is preserved across compartment size changes.  Upon such size
changes, the value of the concentration or density must be recalculated
from the simple relationship <em>concentration = amount / size</em> if
the value of the concentration is needed (for example, if the species
identifier appears in a mathematical formula or is otherwise referenced
in an SBML construct).  There is one exception: if the species' quantity
is determined by an AssignmentRule, RateRule, AlgebraicRule, or an
EventAssignment and the species has a "hasOnlySubstanceUnits" attribute
value of C<false>, it means that the <em>concentration</em> is assigned
by the rule or event; in that case, the <em>amount</em> must be
calculated when the compartment size changes.  (Events also require
additional care in this situation, because an event with multiple
assignments could conceivably reassign both a species quantity and a
compartment size simultaneously.  Please refer to the SBML
specifications for the details.)
Note that the above only matters if a species has a
"hasOnlySubstanceUnits" attribute value of C<false>, meaning that the
species identifier refers to a concentration wherever the identifier
appears in a mathematical formula.  If instead the attribute's value is
C<true>, then the identifier of the species <em>always</em> stands for
an amount wherever it appears in a mathematical formula or is referenced
by an SBML construct.  In that case, there is never a question about
whether an assignment or event is meant to affect the amount or
concentration: it is always the amount.
A particularly confusing situation can occur when the species has
"constant" attribute value of C<true> in combination with a
"hasOnlySubstanceUnits" attribute value of C<false>.  Suppose this
species is given a value for "initialConcentration".  Does a "constant"
value of C<true> mean that the concentration is held constant if the
compartment size changes?  No; it is still the amount that is kept
constant across a compartment size change.  The fact that the species
was initialized using a concentration value is irrelevant.

=head2 ListOfSpecies

LibSBML implementation of SBML Level&nbsp;2's ListOfSpecies construct.
The various ListOf___ classes in SBML are merely containers used for
organizing the main components of an SBML model.  All are derived from
the abstract class SBase, and inherit the various attributes and
subelements of SBase, such as "metaid" as and "annotation".  The
ListOf___ classes do not add any attributes of their own.
The relationship between the lists and the rest of an SBML model is
illustrated by the following (for SBML Level&nbsp;2 Version&nbsp;4):
@image html listof-illustration.jpg "ListOf___ elements in an SBML Model"
@image latex listof-illustration.jpg "ListOf___ elements in an SBML Model"
Readers may wonder about the motivations for using the ListOf___
containers.  A simpler approach in XML might be to place the components
all directly at the top level of the model definition.  We chose instead
to group them within XML elements named after ListOf<em>Classname</em>,
in part because we believe this helps organize the components and makes
visual reading of models in XML easier.  More importantly, the fact that
the container classes are derived from SBase means that software tools
can add information about the lists themselves into each list
container's "annotation".

=item Species::Species

Creates a new Species using the given SBML C<level> and C<version>
values.

@param level an unsigned int, the SBML Level to assign to this Species
@param version an unsigned int, the SBML Version to assign to this
Species

@note Upon the addition of a Species object to an SBMLDocument (e.g.,
using Model::addSpecies()), the SBML Level, SBML Version and XML
namespace of the document I<override> the values used when creating
the Species object via this constructor.  This is necessary to ensure
that an SBML document is a consistent structure.  Nevertheless, the
ability to supply the values at the time of creation of a Species is
an important aid to producing valid SBML.  Knowledge of the intented
SBML Level and Version determine whether it is valid to assign a
particular value to an attribute, or whether it is valid to add an
object to an existing SBMLDocument.


=item Species::Species

Creates a new Species using the given SBMLNamespaces object
C<sbmlns>.
The SBMLNamespaces object encapsulates SBML Level/Version/namespaces
information.  It is used to communicate the SBML Level, Version, and
(in Level&nbsp;3) packages used in addition to SBML Level&nbsp;3 Core.
A common approach to using this class constructor is to create an
SBMLNamespaces object somewhere in a program, once, then pass it to
object constructors such as this one when needed.
It is worth emphasizing that although this constructor does not take
an identifier argument, in SBML Level&nbsp;2 and beyond, the "id"
(identifier) attribute of a Species is required to have a value.
Thus, callers are cautioned to assign a value after calling this
constructor.  Setting the identifier can be accomplished using the
method @if clike setId() @endif@if java setId(String id) @endif.
@param sbmlns an SBMLNamespaces object.
@note Upon the addition of a Species object to an SBMLDocument (e.g.,
using Model::addSpecies()), the SBML XML namespace of the document @em
overrides the value used when creating the Species object via this
constructor.  This is necessary to ensure that an SBML document is a
consistent structure.  Nevertheless, the ability to supply the values
at the time of creation of a Species is an important aid to producing
valid SBML.  Knowledge of the intented SBML Level and Version
determine whether it is valid to assign a particular value to an
attribute, or whether it is valid to add an object to an existing
SBMLDocument.



=item Species::Species

Copy constructor; creates a copy of this Species.


=item Species::accept

Accepts the given SBMLVisitor for this instance of Species.
@param v the SBMLVisitor instance to be used.
Returns the result of calling C<v.visit()>.


=item Species::clone

Creates and returns a deep copy of this Species object.
Returns a (deep) copy of this Species.


=item Species::initDefaults

Initializes the fields of this Species object to "typical" defaults
values.

The SBML Species component has slightly different aspects and
default attribute values in different SBML Levels and Versions.
This method sets the values to certain common defaults, based
mostly on what they are in SBML Level&nbsp;2.  Specifically:

=over


=item

Sets "boundaryCondition" to C<false>

=item

Sets "constant" to C<false>

=item

sets "hasOnlySubstanceUnits" to C<false>

Returns the id of this Species.


=item Species::getName

Returns the value of the "name" attribute of this Species object.
Returns the name of this Species.


=item Species::getSpeciesType

Get the type of this Species object object.
Returns the value of the "speciesType" attribute of this
Species as a string.
@note The "speciesType" attribute is only available in SBML
Level&nbsp;2 Versions&nbsp;2&ndash;4.


=item Species::getCompartment

Get the compartment in which this species is located.
The compartment is designated by its identifier.
Returns the value of the "compartment" attribute of this Species

Get the value of the "initialConcentration" attribute.
Returns the initialConcentration of this Species,, as a float-point
number.

@note The attribute "initialConcentration" is only available in SBML
Level&nbsp;2 and&nbsp;3.  It does not exist on Species in Level&nbsp;1.


=item Species::getSubstanceUnits

Get the value of the "substanceUnits" attribute.
Returns the value of the "substanceUnits" attribute of this Species,
as a string.  An empty string indicates that no units have been
assigned.

@note @htmlinclude unassigned-units-are-not-a-default.html

@see setSubstanceUnits(const std::string& sid)


=item Species::getSpatialSizeUnits

Get the value of the "spatialSizeUnits" attribute.
Returns the value of the "spatialSizeUnits" attribute of this Species
object, as a string.
@warning In versions of SBML Level&nbsp;2 before Version&nbsp;3, the
class Species included an attribute called "spatialSizeUnits", which
allowed explicitly setting the units of size for initial
concentration.  This attribute was removed in SBML Level&nbsp;2
Version&nbsp;3.  LibSBML retains this attribute for compatibility with
older definitions of Level&nbsp;2, but its use is strongly discouraged
because it is incompatible with Level&nbsp;2 Version&nbsp;3 and
Level&nbsp;2 Version&nbsp;4.


=item Species::getUnits

Get the value of the "units" attribute.
Returns the units of this Species (L1 only).
@note The "units" attribute is defined only in SBML Level&nbsp;1.  In
SBML Level&nbsp;2 and Level&nbsp;3, it has been replaced by a
combination of "substanceUnits" and the units of the Compartment
object in which a species is located.  In SBML Level&nbsp;2
Versions&nbsp;1&ndash;2, an additional attribute "spatialSizeUnits"
helps determine the units of the species quantity, but this attribute
was removed in later versions of SBML Level&nbsp;2.


=item Species::getHasOnlySubstanceUnits

Get the value of the "hasOnlySubstanceUnits" attribute.
Returns C<true> if this Species' "hasOnlySubstanceUnits" attribute
value is nonzero, C<false> otherwise.
@note The "hasOnlySubstanceUnits" attribute does not exist in SBML
Level&nbsp;1.



=item Species::getBoundaryCondition

Get the value of the "boundaryCondition" attribute.
Returns C<true> if this Species' "boundaryCondition" attribute value
is nonzero, C<false> otherwise.


=item Species::getCharge

Get the value of the "charge" attribute.
Returns the charge of this Species.
@note Beginning in SBML Level&nbsp;2 Version&nbsp;2, the "charge"
attribute on Species is deprecated and in SBML Level&nbsp;3 it does
not exist at all.  Its use strongly discouraged.  Its presence is
considered a misfeature in earlier definitions of SBML because its
implications for the mathematics of a model were never defined, and in
any case, no known modeling system ever used it.  Instead, models take
account of charge values directly in their definitions of species by
(for example) having separate species identities for the charged and
uncharged versions of the same species.  This allows the condition to
affect model mathematics directly.  LibSBML retains this method for
easier compatibility with SBML Level&nbsp;1.


=item Species::getConstant

Get the value of the "constant" attribute.
Returns C<true> if this Species's "constant" attribute value is
nonzero, C<false> otherwise.
@note The attribute "constant" is only available in SBML Levels&nbsp;2
and&nbsp;3.  It does not exist on Species in Level&nbsp;1.


=item Species::getConversionFactor

Get the value of the "conversionFactor" attribute.
Returns the conversionFactor of this Species, as a string.
@note The "conversionFactor" attribute was introduced in SBML
Level&nbsp;3.  It does not exist on Species in SBML Levels&nbsp;1
and&nbsp;2.

=item Species::isSetInitialAmount

Predicate returning C<true> if this
Species's "initialAmount" attribute has been set.
Returns C<true> if the "initialAmount" attribute of this Species has
been set, C<false> otherwise.
@note In SBML Level&nbsp;1, Species' "initialAmount" is required and
therefore <em>should always be set</em>.  (However, in Level&nbsp;1, the
attribute has no default value either, so this method will not return
C<true> until a value has been assigned.)  In SBML Level&nbsp;2,
"initialAmount" is optional and as such may or may not be set.


=item Species::isSetInitialConcentration

Predicate returning C<true> if this
Species's "initialConcentration" attribute has been set.
Returns C<true> if the "initialConcentration" attribute of this Species has

Constructs and returns a UnitDefinition that corresponds to the units

"substanceUnits", the units are taken from the enclosing Model's
definition of C<"substance"> or C<"substance">/<em>(size of the
compartment)</em> in which the species is located, or finally, if
these are not redefined by the Model, the relevant SBML default units
for those quantities.  Following that procedure, the method
getDerivedUnitDefinition() returns a UnitDefinition based on the
interpreted units of this species's amount or concentration.
Note that the functionality that facilitates unit analysis depends 
on the model as a whole.  Thus, in cases where the object has not 
been added to a model or the model itself is incomplete,
unit analysis is not possible and this method will return C<NULL>.
Note also that unit declarations for Species are in terms of the @em
identifier of a unit, but this method returns a UnitDefinition object,
not a unit identifier.  It does this by constructing an appropriate
UnitDefinition.  Callers may find this particularly useful when used
in conjunction with the helper methods on UnitDefinition for comparing
different UnitDefinition objects.
In SBML Level&nbsp;2 specifications prior to Version&nbsp;3, Species
includes an additional attribute named "spatialSizeUnits", which
allows explicitly setting the units of size for initial concentration.
The getDerivedUnitDefinition() takes this into account for models
expressed in SBML Level&nbsp;2 Versions&nbsp;1 and&nbsp;2.
Returns a UnitDefinition that expresses the units of this 
Species, or C<NULL> if one cannot be constructed.

=item Species::getDerivedUnitDefinition

Constructs and returns a UnitDefinition that corresponds to the units
of this Species' amount or concentration.
Species in SBML have an attribute ("substanceUnits") for declaring the
units of measurement intended for the species' amount or concentration
(depending on which one applies).  In the absence of a value given for
"substanceUnits", the units are taken from the enclosing Model's
definition of C<"substance"> or C<"substance">/<em>(size of the
compartment)</em> in which the species is located, or finally, if
these are not redefined by the Model, the relevant SBML default units
for those quantities.  Following that procedure, the method

=head2 Parameter

LibSBML implementation of SBML's Parameter construct.
A Parameter is used in SBML to define a symbol associated with a value;
this symbol can then be used in mathematical formulas in a model.  By
default, parameters have constant value for the duration of a
simulation, and for this reason are called I<parameters> instead of @em
variables in SBML, although it is crucial to understand that <em>SBML
parameters represent both concepts</em>.  Whether a given SBML
parameter is intended to be constant or variable is indicated by the
value of its "constant" attribute.
SBML's Parameter has a required attribute, "id", that gives the
parameter a unique identifier by which other parts of an SBML model
definition can refer to it.  A parameter can also have an optional
"name" attribute of type C<string>.  Identifiers and names must be used
according to the guidelines described in the SBML specifications.
The optional attribute "value" determines the value (of type C<double>)
assigned to the parameter.  A missing value for "value" implies that
the value either is unknown, or to be obtained from an external source,
or determined by an initial assignment.  The unit of measurement
associated with the value of the parameter can be specified using the
optional attribute "units".  Here we only mention briefly some notable
points about the possible unit choices, but readers are urged to consult
the SBML specification documents for more information:

=over



=item

In SBML Level&nbsp;3, there are no constraints on the units that
can be assigned to parameters in a model; there are also no units to
inherit from the enclosing Model object (unlike the case for, e.g.,
Species and Compartment).

=item

In SBML Level&nbsp;2, the value assigned to the parameter's "units"
attribute must be chosen from one of the following possibilities: one of
the base unit identifiers defined in SBML; one of the built-in unit
identifiers C<"substance">, C<"time">, C<"volume">, C<"area"> or @c
"length"; or the identifier of a new unit defined in the list of unit
definitions in the enclosing Model structure.  There are no constraints
on the units that can be chosen from these sets.  There are no default
units for parameters.

=back


The Parameter structure has another boolean attribute named "constant"
that is used to indicate whether the parameter's value can vary during a
simulation.  (In SBML Level&nbsp;3, the attribute is mandatory and must
be given a value; in SBML Levels below Level&nbsp;3, the attribute is
optional.)  A value of C<true> indicates the parameter's value cannot be
changed by any construct except InitialAssignment.  Conversely, if the
value of "constant" is C<false>, other constructs in SBML, such as rules
and events, can change the value of the parameter.
SBML Level&nbsp;3 uses a separate object class, LocalParameter, for
parameters that are local to a Reaction's KineticLaw.  In Levels prior
to SBML Level&nbsp;3, the Parameter class is used both for definitions
of global parameters, as well as reaction-local parameters stored in a
list within KineticLaw objects.  Parameter objects that are local to a
reaction (that is, those defined within the KineticLaw structure of a
Reaction) cannot be changed by rules and therefore are <em>implicitly
always constant</em>; consequently, in SBML Level&nbsp;2, parameter
definitions within Reaction structures should I<not> have their
"constant" attribute set to C<false>.
What if a global parameter has its "constant" attribute set to C<false>,
but the model does not contain any rules, events or other constructs
that ever change its value over time?  Although the model may be
suspect, this situation is not strictly an error.  A value of C<false>
for "constant" only indicates that a parameter I<can> change value, not
that it I<must>.
As with all other major SBML components, Parameter is derived from
SBase, and the methods defined on SBase are available on Parameter.
@see ListOfParameters
@note The use of the term I<parameter> in SBML sometimes leads to
confusion among readers who have a particular notion of what something
called "parameter" should be.  It has been the source of heated debate,
but despite this, no one has yet found an adequate replacement term that
does not have different connotations to different people and hence leads
to confusion among I<some> subset of users.  Perhaps it would have been
better to have two constructs, one called I<constants> and the other
called I<variables>.  The current approach in SBML is simply more
parsimonious, using a single Parameter construct with the boolean flag
"constant" indicating which flavor it is.  In any case, readers are
implored to look past their particular definition of a I<parameter> and
simply view SBML's Parameter as a single mechanism for defining both
constants and (additional) variables in a model.  (We write @em
additional because the species in a model are usually considered to be
the central variables.)  After all, software tools are not required to
expose to users the actual names of particular SBML constructs, and
thus tools can present to their users whatever terms their designers
feel best matches their target audience.

=head2 ListOfParameters

LibSBML implementation of SBML's ListOfParameters construct.
The various ListOf___ classes in SBML are merely containers used for
organizing the main components of an SBML model.  All are derived from
the abstract class SBase, and inherit the various attributes and
subelements of SBase, such as "metaid" as and "annotation".  The
ListOf___ classes do not add any attributes of their own.
The relationship between the lists and the rest of an SBML model is
illustrated by the following (for SBML Level&nbsp;2 Version&nbsp;4):
@image html listof-illustration.jpg "ListOf___ elements in an SBML Model"
@image latex listof-illustration.jpg "ListOf___ elements in an SBML Model"
Readers may wonder about the motivations for using the ListOf___
containers.  A simpler approach in XML might be to place the components
all directly at the top level of the model definition.  We chose instead
to group them within XML elements named after ListOf<em>Classname</em>,
in part because we believe this helps organize the components and makes
visual reading of models in XML easier.  More importantly, the fact that
the container classes are derived from SBase means that software tools
can add information about the lists themselves into each list
container's "annotation".

=item Parameter::Parameter

Creates a new Parameter using the given SBML C<level> and C<version>
values.

@param level an unsigned int, the SBML Level to assign to this Parameter
@param version an unsigned int, the SBML Version to assign to this
Parameter

@note Upon the addition of a Parameter object to an SBMLDocument
(e.g., using Model::addParameter()), the SBML Level, SBML Version
and XML namespace of the document I<override> the values used
when creating the Parameter object via this constructor.  This is
necessary to ensure that an SBML document is a consistent structure.
Nevertheless, the ability to supply the values at the time of creation
of a Parameter is an important aid to producing valid SBML.  Knowledge
of the intented SBML Level and Version determine whether it is valid
to assign a particular value to an attribute, or whether it is valid
to add an object to an existing SBMLDocument.


=item Parameter::Parameter

Creates a new Parameter using the given SBMLNamespaces object
C<sbmlns>.
The SBMLNamespaces object encapsulates SBML Level/Version/namespaces
information.  It is used to communicate the SBML Level, Version, and
(in Level&nbsp;3) packages used in addition to SBML Level&nbsp;3 Core.
A common approach to using this class constructor is to create an
SBMLNamespaces object somewhere in a program, once, then pass it to
object constructors such as this one when needed.
It is worth emphasizing that although this constructor does not take
an identifier argument, in SBML Level&nbsp;2 and beyond, the "id"
(identifier) attribute of a Parameter is required to have a value.
Thus, callers are cautioned to assign a value after calling this
constructor if no identifier is provided as an argument.  Setting the
identifier can be accomplished using the method
@if clike setId()@endif@if java setId(String id)@endif.
@param sbmlns an SBMLNamespaces object.
@note Upon the addition of a Parameter object to an SBMLDocument
(e.g., using Model::addParameter()), the SBML XML namespace of the
document I<overrides> the value used when creating the Parameter
object via this constructor.  This is necessary to ensure that an SBML
document is a consistent structure.  Nevertheless, the ability to
supply the values at the time of creation of a Parameter is an
important aid to producing valid SBML.  Knowledge of the intented SBML
Level and Version determine whether it is valid to assign a particular
value to an attribute, or whether it is valid to add an object to an
existing SBMLDocument.


=item Parameter::Parameter

Copy constructor; creates a copy of a Parameter.
@param orig the Parameter instance to copy.


=item Parameter::accept

Accepts the given SBMLVisitor for this instance of Parameter.
@param v the SBMLVisitor instance to be used.
Returns the result of calling C<v.visit()>, indicating
whether the Visitor would like to visit the next Parameter object in
the list of parameters within which I<the> present object is
embedded.



=item Parameter::clone

Creates and returns a deep copy of this Parameter.
Returns a (deep) copy of this Parameter.


=item Parameter::initDefaults

Initializes the fields of this Parameter object to "typical" defaults
values.

The SBML Parameter component has slightly different aspects and
default attribute values in different SBML Levels and Versions.  Many
SBML object classes defined by libSBML have an initDefaults() method
to set the values to certain common defaults, based mostly on what
they are in SBML Level&nbsp;2.  In the case of Parameter, this method
only sets the value of the "constant" attribute to C<true>.


=item Parameter::getId

Returns the value of the "id" attribute of this Parameter.
Returns the id of this Parameter.


=item Parameter::getName

Returns the value of the "name" attribute of this Parameter.
Returns the name of this Parameter.


=item Parameter::getValue

Gets the numerical value of this Parameter.
Returns the value of the "value" attribute of this Parameter, as a
number of type C<double>.
@note B<It is crucial> that callers not blindly call
Parameter::getValue() without first using Parameter::isSetValue() to
determine whether a value has ever been set.  Otherwise, the value
return by Parameter::getValue() may not actually represent a value
assigned to the parameter.  The reason is simply that the data type
C<double> in a program always has I<some> value.  A separate test is
needed to determine whether the value is a true model value, or
uninitialized data in a computer's memory location.

=item Parameter::getUnits

Gets the units defined for this Parameter.
The value of an SBML parameter's "units" attribute establishes the
unit of measurement associated with the parameter's value.
Returns the value of the "units" attribute of this Parameter, as a
string.  An empty string indicates that no units have been assigned.

Predicate returning C<true> if the
"value" attribute of this Parameter has been set.
In SBML definitions after SBML Level&nbsp;1 Version&nbsp;1,
parameter values are optional and have no defaults.  If a model read
from a file does not contain a setting for the "value" attribute of a
parameter, its value is considered unset; it does not default to any
particular value.  Similarly, when a Parameter object is created in
libSBML, it has no value until given a value.  The
Parameter::isSetValue() method allows calling applications to
determine whether a given parameter's value has ever been set.
In SBML Level&nbsp;1 Version&nbsp;1, parameters are required to have
values and therefore, the value of a Parameter B<should always be
set>.  In Level&nbsp;1 Version&nbsp;2 and beyond, the value is
optional and as such, the "value" attribute may or may not be set.
Returns C<true> if the value of this Parameter has been set,
C<false> otherwise.

=head2 LocalParameter

LibSBML implementation of SBML Level&nbsp;3's LocalParameter construct.
LocalParameter has been introduced in SBML Level&nbsp;3 to serve as the
object class for parameter definitions that are intended to be local to
a Reaction.  Objects of class LocalParameter never appear at the Model
level; they are always contained within ListOfLocalParameters lists
which are in turn contained within KineticLaw objects.
Like its global Parameter counterpart, the LocalParameter object class
is used to define a symbol associated with a value; this symbol can then
be used in a model's mathematical formulas (and specifically, for
LocalParameter, reaction rate formulas).  Unlike Parameter, the
LocalParameter class does not have a "constant" attribute: local
parameters within reactions are I<always> constant.
LocalParameter has one required attribute, "id", to give the
parameter a unique identifier by which other parts of an SBML model
definition can refer to it.  A parameter can also have an optional
"name" attribute of type C<string>.  Identifiers and names must be used
according to the guidelines described in the SBML specifications.
The optional attribute "value" determines the value (of type C<double>)
assigned to the parameter.  A missing value for "value" implies that
the value either is unknown, or to be obtained from an external source,
or determined by an initial assignment.  The unit of measurement
associated with the value of the parameter can be specified using the
optional attribute "units".  Here we only mention briefly some notable
points about the possible unit choices, but readers are urged to consult
the SBML specification documents for more information:

=over



=item

In SBML Level&nbsp;3, there are no constraints on the units that
can be assigned to parameters in a model; there are also no units to
inherit from the enclosing Model object.

=item

In SBML Level&nbsp;2, the value assigned to the parameter's "units"
attribute must be chosen from one of the following possibilities: one of
the base unit identifiers defined in SBML; one of the built-in unit
identifiers C<"substance">, C<"time">, C<"volume">, C<"area"> or @c
"length"; or the identifier of a new unit defined in the list of unit
definitions in the enclosing Model structure.  There are no constraints
on the units that can be chosen from these sets.  There are no default
units for local parameters.

=back


As with all other major SBML components, LocalParameter is derived from
SBase, and the methods defined on SBase are available on LocalParameter.
@warning LibSBML derives LocalParameter from Parameter; however, this
does not precisely match the object hierarchy defined by SBML
Level&nbsp;3, where LocalParamter is derived directly from SBase and not
Parameter.  We believe this arrangement makes it easier for libSBML
users to program applications that work with both SBML Level&nbsp;2 and
SBML Level&nbsp;3, but programmers should also keep in mind this
difference exists.  A side-effect of libSBML's scheme is that certain
methods on LocalParameter that are inherited from Parameter do not
actually have relevance to LocalParameter objects.  An example of this
is the methods pertaining to Parameter's attribute "constant"
(i.e., isSetConstant(), setConstant(), and getConstant()).

=head2 ListOfLocalParameters

LibSBML implementation of SBML's ListOfLocalParameters construct.
The various ListOf___ classes in SBML are merely containers used for
organizing the main components of an SBML model.  All are derived from
the abstract class SBase, and inherit the various attributes and
subelements of SBase, such as "metaid" as and "annotation".  The
ListOf___ classes do not add any attributes of their own.
ListOfLocalParameters is a subsidiary object class used only within
KineticLaw.  A KineticLaw object can have a single object of class
ListOfLocalParameters containing a set of local parameters used in that
kinetic law definition.
Readers may wonder about the motivations for using the ListOf___
containers.  A simpler approach in XML might be to place the components
all directly at the top level of the model definition.  We chose instead
to group them within XML elements named after ListOf<em>Classname</em>,
in part because we believe this helps organize the components and makes
visual reading of models in XML easier.  More importantly, the fact that
the container classes are derived from SBase means that software tools
can add information about the lists themselves into each list
container's "annotation".

=item LocalParameter::LocalParameter

Creates a new LocalParameter object with the given SBML C<level> and
C<version> values.
@param level an unsigned int, the SBML Level to assign to this
LocalParameter.

@param version an unsigned int, the SBML Version to assign to this
LocalParameter.

@note Upon the addition of a LocalParameter object to an SBMLDocument
(e.g., using KineticLaw::addLocalParameter()), the SBML Level, SBML
Version and XML namespace of the document I<override> the
values used when creating the LocalParameter object via this
constructor.  This is necessary to ensure that an SBML document is a
consistent structure.  Nevertheless, the ability to supply the values
at the time of creation of a LocalParameter is an important aid to
producing valid SBML.  Knowledge of the intented SBML Level and
Version determine whether it is valid to assign a particular value to
an attribute, or whether it is valid to add an object to an existing
SBMLDocument.



=item LocalParameter::LocalParameter

Creates a new LocalParameter object with the given SBMLNamespaces
object C<sbmlns>.
The SBMLNamespaces object encapsulates SBML Level/Version/namespaces
information.  It is used to communicate the SBML Level, Version, and
(in Level&nbsp;3) packages used in addition to SBML Level&nbsp;3 Core.
A common approach to using this class constructor is to create an
SBMLNamespaces object somewhere in a program, once, then pass it to
object constructors such as this one when needed.
It is worth emphasizing that although this constructor does not take
an identifier argument, in SBML Level&nbsp;2 and beyond, the "id"
(identifier) attribute of a LocalParameter is required to have a value.
Thus, callers are cautioned to assign a value after calling this
constructor if no identifier is provided as an argument.  Setting the
identifier can be accomplished using the method
@if clike setId()@endif@if java setId(String id)@endif.
@param sbmlns an SBMLNamespaces object.
@note Upon the addition of a LocalParameter object to an SBMLDocument
(e.g., using Model::addLocalParameter()), the SBML XML namespace of
the document I<overrides> the value used when creating the
LocalParameter object via this constructor.  This is necessary to
ensure that an SBML document is a consistent structure.  Nevertheless,
the ability to supply the values at the time of creation of a
LocalParameter is an important aid to producing valid SBML.  Knowledge
of the intented SBML Level and Version determine whether it is valid
to assign a particular value to an attribute, or whether it is valid
to add an object to an existing SBMLDocument.

@param v the SBMLVisitor instance to be used.
Returns the result of calling C<v.visit()>, which indicates
whether the Visitor would like to visit the next LocalParameter in the list
of parameters within which this LocalParameter is embedded (i.e., either
the list of parameters in the parent Model or the list of parameters
in the enclosing KineticLaw).


=item LocalParameter::clone

Creates and returns a deep copy of this LocalParameter.
Returns a (deep) copy of this LocalParameter.


=item LocalParameter::getDerivedUnitDefinition

Constructs and returns a UnitDefinition that corresponds to the units
of this LocalParameter's value.
LocalParameters in SBML have an attribute ("units") for declaring the
units of measurement intended for the parameter's value.  B<No
defaults are defined> by SBML in the absence of a definition for
"units".  This method returns a UnitDefinition object based on the
units declared for this LocalParameter using its "units" attribute, or
it returns C<NULL> if no units have been declared.
Note that unit declarations for LocalParameter objects are specified
in terms of the I<identifier> of a unit (e.g., using setUnits()), but
I<this> method returns a UnitDefinition object, not a unit
identifier.  It does this by constructing an appropriate
UnitDefinition.  For SBML Level&nbsp;2 models, it will do this even
when the value of the "units" attribute is one of the predefined SBML
units C<"substance">, C<"volume">, C<"area">, C<"length"> or @c
"time".  Callers may find this useful in conjunction with the helper
methods provided by the UnitDefinition class for comparing different
UnitDefinition objects.
Returns a UnitDefinition that expresses the units of this 
LocalParameter, or C<NULL> if one cannot be constructed.

=item LocalParameter::getDerivedUnitDefinition

Constructs and returns a UnitDefinition that corresponds to the units
of this LocalParameter's value.
LocalParameters in SBML have an attribute ("units") for declaring the
units of measurement intended for the parameter's value.  B<No
defaults are defined> by SBML in the absence of a definition for
"units".  This method returns a UnitDefinition object based on the
units declared for this LocalParameter using its "units" attribute, or
it returns C<NULL> if no units have been declared.
Note that unit declarations for LocalParameter objects are specified
in terms of the I<identifier> of a unit (e.g., using setUnits()), but
I<this> method returns a UnitDefinition object, not a unit
identifier.  It does this by constructing an appropriate
UnitDefinition.  For SBML Level&nbsp;2 models, it will do this even
when the value of the "units" attribute is one of the predefined SBML
units C<"substance">, C<"volume">, C<"area">, C<"length"> or @c
"time".  Callers may find this useful in conjunction with the helper
methods provided by the UnitDefinition class for comparing different
UnitDefinition objects.
Returns a UnitDefinition that expresses the units of this 
LocalParameter, or C<NULL> if one cannot be constructed.

=head2 InitialAssignment

LibSBML implementation of SBML's InitialAssignment construct.
SBML Level 2 Versions 2, 3 and 4 provide two ways of assigning initial
values to entities in a model.  The simplest and most basic is to set
the values of the appropriate attributes in the relevant components; for
example, the initial value of a model parameter (whether it is a
constant or a variable) can be assigned by setting its "value" attribute
directly in the model definition.  However, this approach is not
suitable when the value must be calculated, because the initial value
attributes on different components such as species, compartments, and
parameters are single values and not mathematical expressions.  In those
situations, the InitialAssignment construct can be used; it permits the
calculation of the value of a constant or the initial value of a
variable from the values of I<other> quantities in a model.
As explained below, the provision of InitialAssignment does not mean
that models necessarily must use this construct when defining initial
values of quantities in a model.  If a value can be set directly using
the relevant attribute of a component in a model, then that
approach may be more efficient and more portable to other software
tools.  InitialAssignment should be used when the other mechanism is
insufficient for the needs of a particular model.
The InitialAssignment construct has some similarities to AssignmentRule.
The main differences are: (a) an InitialAssignment can set the value of
a constant whereas an AssignmentRule cannot, and (b) unlike
AssignmentRule, an InitialAssignment definition only applies up to and
including the beginning of simulation time, i.e., <em>t \f$\leq\f$ 0</em>,
while an AssignmentRule applies at all times.
InitialAssignment has a required attribute, "symbol", whose value must
follow the guidelines for identifiers described in the SBML
specification (e.g., Section 3.3 in the Level 2 Version 4
specification).  The value of this attribute in an InitialAssignment
object can be the identifier of a Compartment, Species or global
Parameter elsewhere in the model.  The InitialAssignment defines the
initial value of the constant or variable referred to by the "symbol"
attribute.  (The attribute's name is "symbol" rather than "variable"
because it may assign values to constants as well as variables in a
model.)  Note that an initial assignment cannot be made to reaction
identifiers, that is, the "symbol" attribute value of an
InitialAssignment cannot be an identifier that is the "id" attribute
value of a Reaction object in the model.  This is identical to a
restriction placed on rules.
InitialAssignment also has a required "math" subelement that contains a
MathML expression used to calculate the value of the constant or the
initial value of the variable.  The units of the value computed by the
formula in the "math" subelement should (in SBML Level&nbsp;2
Version&nbsp;4) or must (in previous Versions) be identical to be the
units associated with the identifier given in the "symbol" attribute.
(That is, the units are the units of the species, compartment, or
parameter, as appropriate for the kind of object identified by the value
of "symbol".)
InitialAssignment was introduced in SBML Level 2 Version 2.  It is not
available in earlier versions of Level 2 nor in any version of Level 1.
@section initassign-semantics Semantics of Initial Assignments
The value calculated by an InitialAssignment object overrides the value
assigned to the given symbol by the object defining that symbol.  For
example, if a compartment's "size" attribute is set in its definition,
and the model also contains an InitialAssignment having that
compartment's identifier as its "symbol" attribute value, then the
interpretation is that the "size" assigned in the Compartment object
should be ignored and the value assigned based on the computation
defined in the InitialAssignment.  Initial assignments can take place
for Compartment, Species and global Parameter objects regardless of the
value of their "constant" attribute.
The actions of all InitialAssignment objects are in general terms
the same, but differ in the precise details depending on the type
of variable being set:

=over


=item

<em>In the case of a species</em>, an InitialAssignment sets the
referenced species' initial quantity (concentration or amount of
substance) to the value determined by the formula in the "math"
subelement.    The overall units of the formula should (in SBML
Level&nbsp;2 Version&nbsp;4) or must (in previous Versions) be the same
as the units specified for the species.

=item

<em>In the case of a compartment</em>, an InitialAssignment sets
the referenced compartment's initial size to the size determined by the
formula in "math".  The overall units of the formula should (in SBML
Level&nbsp;2 Version&nbsp;4) or must (in previous Versions) be the same
as the units specified for the size of the compartment.

=item

<em>In the case of a parameter</em>, an InitialAssignment sets the
referenced parameter's initial value to that determined by the formula
in "math".  The overall units of the formula should (in SBML
Level&nbsp;2 Version&nbsp;4) or must (in previous Versions) be the same
as the units defined for the parameter.  
=back

In the context of a simulation, initial assignments establish values
that are in effect prior to and including the start of simulation time,
i.e., <em>t \f$\leq\f$ 0</em>.  Section 3.4.8 in the SBML Level 2
Version 4 specification provides information about the interpretation of
assignments, rules, and entity values for simulation time up to and
including the start time <em>t = 0</em>; this is important for
establishing the initial conditions of a simulation if the model
involves expressions containing the <em>delay</em> "csymbol".
There cannot be two initial assignments for the same symbol in a model;
that is, a model must not contain two or more InitialAssignment objects
that both have the same identifier as their "symbol" attribute value.  A
model must also not define initial assignments <em>and</em> assignment
rules for the same entity.  That is, there cannot be <em>both</em> an
InitialAssignment and an AssignmentRule for the same symbol in a model,
because both kinds of constructs apply prior to and at the start of
simulated time&mdash;allowing both to exist for a given symbol would
result in indeterminism).
The ordering of InitialAssignment objects is not significant.  The
combined set of InitialAssignment, AssignmentRule and KineticLaw
objects form a set of assignment statements that must be considered as a
whole.  The combined set of assignment statements should not contain
algebraic loops: a chain of dependency between these statements should
terminate.  (More formally, consider the directed graph of assignment
statements where nodes are a model's assignment statements and directed
arcs exist for each occurrence of a symbol in an assignment statement
"math" attribute.  The directed arcs in this graph start from the
statement assigning the symbol and end at the statement that contains
the symbol in their math elements.  Such a graph must be acyclic.)
Finally, it is worth being explicit about the expected behavior in the
following situation.  Suppose (1) a given symbol has a value <em>x</em>
assigned to it in its definition, and (2) there is an initial assignment
having the identifier as its "symbol" value and reassigning the value to
<em>y</em>, <em>and</em> (3) the identifier is also used in the
mathematical formula of a second initial assignment.  What value should
the second initial assignment use?  It is <em>y</em>, the value assigned
to the symbol by the first initial assignment, not whatever value was
given in the symbol's definition.  This follows directly from the
behavior described above: if an InitialAssignment object exists for a
given symbol, then the symbol's value is overridden by that initial
assignment.

=head2 ListOfInitialAssignments

LibSBML implementation of SBML's ListOfInitialAssignments construct.
The various ListOf___ classes in SBML are merely containers used for
organizing the main components of an SBML model.  All are derived from
the abstract class SBase, and inherit the various attributes and
subelements of SBase, such as "metaid" as and "annotation".  The
ListOf___ classes do not add any attributes of their own.
The relationship between the lists and the rest of an SBML model is
illustrated by the following (for SBML Level&nbsp;2 Version&nbsp;4):
@image html listof-illustration.jpg "ListOf___ elements in an SBML Model"
@image latex listof-illustration.jpg "ListOf___ elements in an SBML Model"
Readers may wonder about the motivations for using the ListOf___
containers.  A simpler approach in XML might be to place the components
all directly at the top level of the model definition.  We chose instead
to group them within XML elements named after ListOf<em>Classname</em>,
in part because we believe this helps organize the components and makes
visual reading of models in XML easier.  More importantly, the fact that
the container classes are derived from SBase means that software tools
can add information about the lists themselves into each list
container's "annotation".

=head2 Rule

LibSBML implementation of SBML's Rule construct.
In SBML, I<rules> provide additional ways to define the values of
variables in a model, their relationships, and the dynamical behaviors
of those variables.  They enable encoding relationships that cannot be
expressed using Reaction nor InitialAssignment objects alone.
The libSBML implementation of rules mirrors the SBML Level&nbsp;3
Version&nbsp;1 Core definition (which is in turn is very similar to the
Level&nbsp;2 Version&nbsp;4 definition), with Rule being the parent
class of three subclasses as explained below.  The Rule class itself
cannot be instantiated by user programs and has no constructor; only the
subclasses AssignmentRule, AlgebraicRule and RateRule can be
instantiated directly.
@section general General summary of SBML rules
In SBML Level&nbsp;3 as well as Level&nbsp;2, rules are separated into
three subclasses for the benefit of model analysis software.  The three
subclasses are based on the following three different possible
functional forms (where <em>x</em> is a variable, <em>f</em> is some
arbitrary function returning a numerical result, <b><em>V</em></b> is a
vector of variables that does not include <em>x</em>, and
<b><em>W</em></b> is a vector of variables that may include <em>x</em>):
<center>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" style="font-size: small">
<tr><td width="120px"><em>Algebraic:</em></td><td width="250px">left-hand side is zero</td><td><em>0 = f(B<W>)</em></td></tr>
<tr><td><em>Assignment:</em></td><td>left-hand side is a scalar:</td><td><em>x = f(B<V>)</em></td></tr>
<tr><td><em>Rate:</em></td><td>left-hand side is a rate-of-change:</td><td><em>dx/dt = f(B<W>)</em></td></tr>
</table>
</center>
In their general form given above, there is little to distinguish
between <em>assignment</em> and <em>algebraic</em> rules.  They are treated as
separate cases for the following reasons:

=over


=item

<em>Assignment</em> rules can simply be evaluated to calculate
intermediate values for use in numerical methods.  They are statements
of equality that hold at all times.  (For assignments that are only
performed once, see InitialAssignment.)<p>

=item

SBML needs to place restrictions on assignment rules, for example
the restriction that assignment rules cannot contain algebraic loops.<p>

=item

Some simulators do not contain numerical solvers capable of solving
unconstrained algebraic equations, and providing more direct forms such
as assignment rules may enable those simulators to process models they
could not process if the same assignments were put in the form of
general algebraic equations;<p>

=item

Those simulators that <em>can</em> solve these algebraic equations make a
distinction between the different categories listed above; and<p>

=item

Some specialized numerical analyses of models may only be applicable
to models that do not contain <em>algebraic</em> rules.

=back


The approach taken to covering these cases in SBML is to define an
abstract Rule structure containing a subelement, "math", to hold the
right-hand side expression, then to derive subtypes of Rule that add
attributes to distinguish the cases of algebraic, assignment and rate
rules.  The "math" subelement must contain a MathML expression defining the
mathematical formula of the rule.  This MathML formula must return a
numerical value.  The formula can be an arbitrary expression referencing
the variables and other entities in an SBML model.
Each of the three subclasses of Rule (AssignmentRule, AlgebraicRule,
RateRule) inherit the the "math" subelement and other fields from SBase.
The AssignmentRule and RateRule classes add an additional attribute,
"variable".  See the definitions of AssignmentRule, AlgebraicRule and
RateRule for details about the structure and interpretation of each one.
@section additional-restrictions Additional restrictions on SBML rules
An important design goal of SBML rule semantics is to ensure that a
model's simulation and analysis results will not be dependent on when or
how often rules are evaluated.  To achieve this, SBML needs to place two
restrictions on rule use.  The first concerns algebraic loops in the system
of assignments in a model, and the second concerns overdetermined systems.
@subsection no-algebraic-loops A model must not contain algebraic loops
The combined set of InitialAssignment, AssignmentRule and KineticLaw
objects in a model constitute a set of assignment statements that should be
considered as a whole.  (A KineticLaw object is counted as an assignment
because it assigns a value to the symbol contained in the "id" attribute of
the Reaction object in which it is defined.)  This combined set of
assignment statements must not contain algebraic loops&mdash;dependency
chains between these statements must terminate.  To put this more formally,
consider a directed graph in which nodes are assignment statements and
directed arcs exist for each occurrence of an SBML species, compartment or
parameter symbol in an assignment statement's "math" subelement.  Let the
directed arcs point from the statement assigning the symbol to the
statements that contain the symbol in their "math" subelement expressions.
This graph must be acyclic.
SBML does not specify when or how often rules should be evaluated.
Eliminating algebraic loops ensures that assignment statements can be
evaluated any number of times without the result of those evaluations
changing.  As an example, consider the set of equations <em>x = x + 1</em>,
<em>y = z + 200</em> and <em>z = y + 100</em>.  If this set of equations
were interpreted as a set of assignment statements, it would be invalid
because the rule for <em>x</em> refers to <em>x</em> (exhibiting one type
of loop), and the rule for <em>y</em> refers to <em>z</em> while the rule
for <em>z</em> refers back to <em>y</em> (exhibiting another type of loop).
Conversely, the following set of equations would constitute a valid set of
assignment statements: <em>x = 10</em>, <em>y = z + 200</em>, and <em>z = x
+ 100</em>.
@subsection no-overdetermined A model must not be overdetermined
An SBML model must not be overdetermined; that is, a model must not
define more equations than there are unknowns in a model.  An SBML model
that does not contain AlgebraicRule structures cannot be overdetermined.
LibSBML implements the static analysis procedure described in Appendix
B of the SBML Level&nbsp;3 Version&nbsp;1 Core specification for assessing
whether a model is overdetermined.
(In summary, assessing whether a given continuous, deterministic,
mathematical model is overdetermined does not require dynamic analysis; it
can be done by analyzing the system of equations created from the model.
One approach is to construct a bipartite graph in which one set of vertices
represents the variables and the other the set of vertices represents the
equations.  Place edges between vertices such that variables in the system
are linked to the equations that determine them.  For algebraic equations,
there will be edges between the equation and each variable occurring in the
equation.  For ordinary differential equations (such as those defined by
rate rules or implied by the reaction rate definitions), there will be a
single edge between the equation and the variable determined by that
differential equation.  A mathematical model is overdetermined if the
maximal matchings of the bipartite graph contain disconnected vertexes
representing equations.  If one maximal matching has this property, then
all the maximal matchings will have this property; i.e., it is only
necessary to find one maximal matching.)
@section RuleType_t RuleType_t for SBML Level 1
SBML Level 1 uses a different scheme than SBML Level&nbsp;2 and
Level&nbsp;3 for distinguishing rules; specifically, it uses an
attribute whose value is drawn from an enumeration.  LibSBML supports
this using methods that work with the #RuleType_t enumeration.

=head2 AlgebraicRule

LibSBML implementation of SBML's AlgebraicRule construct.
The rule type AlgebraicRule is derived from the parent class Rule.  It
is used to express equations that are neither assignments of model
variables nor rates of change.  AlgebraicRule does not add any
attributes to the basic Rule; its role is simply to distinguish this
case from the other cases.
In the context of a simulation, algebraic rules are in effect at all
times, <em>t</em> \f$\geq\f$ <em>0</em>.  For purposes of evaluating
expressions that involve the delay "csymbol" (see the SBML
specification), algebraic rules are considered to apply also at
<em>t</em> \f$\leq\f$ <em>0</em>.  Please consult the relevant SBML
specification for additional information about the semantics of
assignments, rules, and entity values for simulation time <em>t</em>
\f$\leq\f$ <em>0</em>.
The ability to define arbitrary algebraic expressions in an SBML model
introduces the possibility that a model is mathematically overdetermined
by the overall system of equations constructed from its rules and
reactions.  An SBML model must not be overdetermined.  An SBML model
that does not contain AlgebraicRule structures cannot be overdetermined.
Assessing whether a given continuous, deterministic, mathematical model
is overdetermined does not require dynamic analysis; it can be done by
analyzing the system of equations created from the model.  One approach
is to construct a bipartite graph in which one set of vertices
represents the variables and the other the set of vertices represents
the equations.  Place edges between vertices such that variables in the
system are linked to the equations that determine them.  For algebraic
equations, there will be edges between the equation and each variable
occurring in the equation.  For ordinary differential equations (such as
those defined by rate rules or implied by the reaction rate
definitions), there will be a single edge between the equation and the
variable determined by that differential equation.  A mathematical model
is overdetermined if the maximal matchings of the bipartite graph
contain disconnected vertexes representing equations.  (If one maximal
matching has this property, then all the maximal matchings will have
this property; i.e., it is only necessary to find one maximal matching.)

specification document describes a method of applying this procedure to
specific SBML data objects.

=head2 AssignmentRule

LibSBML implementation of SBML's AssignmentRule construct.
The rule type AssignmentRule is derived from the parent class Rule.  It
is used to express equations that set the values of variables.  The
left-hand side (the attribute named "variable") of an assignment rule
can refer to the identifier of a Species, SpeciesReference (in SBML
Level&nbsp;3), Compartment, or Parameter object in the model (but not a
Reaction).  The entity identified must have its "constant" attribute set
to C<false>.  The effects of an AssignmentRule are in general terms the
same, but differ in the precise details depending on the type of
variable being set: 
=over


=item

<em>In the case of a species</em>, an AssignmentRule sets the
referenced species' quantity (whether a "concentration" or "amount") to
the value determined by the formula in the MathML subelement "math".
The unit associated with the value produced by the "math" formula @em
should (in SBML Level&nbsp;2 Version&nbsp;4 and later) or I<must> (in
SBML releases prior to Level&nbsp;2 version&nbsp;4) be equal to the unit
associated with the species' quantity.  <em>Restrictions</em>: There
must not be both an AssignmentRule "variable" attribute and a
SpeciesReference "species" attribute having the same value, unless the
referenced Species object has its "boundaryCondition" attribute set to
C<true>.  In other words, an assignment rule cannot be defined for a
species that is created or destroyed in a reaction unless that species
is defined as a boundary condition in the model.

=item

(For SBML Level&nbsp;3 only) <em>In the case of a species
reference</em>, an AssignmentRule sets the stoichiometry of the
referenced reactant or product to the value determined by the formula in
"math".  The unit associated with the value produced by the "math"
formula should be consistent with the unit "dimensionless", because

<em>In the case of a compartment</em>, an AssignmentRule sets the

of the formula in "math" I<should> (in SBML Level&nbsp;2 Version&nbsp;4

In the context of a simulation, assignment rules are in effect at all
times, <em>t</em> \f$\geq\f$ <em>0</em>.  For purposes of evaluating
expressions that involve the <em>delay</em> "csymbol" (see the SBML
Level&nbsp;2 specification), assignment rules are considered to apply
also at <em>t</em> \f$\leq\f$ <em>0</em>.  Please consult the relevant
SBML specification for additional information about the semantics of
assignments, rules, and entity values for simulation time <em>t</em>
\f$\leq\f$ <em>0</em>.
A model must not contain more than one AssignmentRule or RateRule
object having the same value of "variable"; in other words, in the set
of all assignment rules and rate rules in an SBML model, each variable
appearing in the left-hand sides can only appear once.  This simply
follows from the fact that an indeterminate system would result if a
model contained more than one assignment rule for the same variable or
both an assignment rule and a rate rule for the same variable.
Similarly, a model must also not contain <em>both</em> an AssignmentRule
and an InitialAssignment for the same variable, because both kinds of
constructs apply prior to and at the start of simulation time, i.e.,
<em>t</em> \f$\leq\f$ <em>0</em>.  If a model contained both an initial
assignment and an assignment rule for the same variable, an
indeterminate system would result.
The value calculated by an AssignmentRule object overrides the value
assigned to the given symbol by the object defining that symbol.  For
example, if a Compartment object's "size" attribute value is set in its
definition, and the model also contains an AssignmentRule object having
that compartment's "id" as its "variable" value, then the "size"
assigned in the Compartment object definition is ignored and the value
assigned based on the computation defined in the AssignmentRule.  This
does <em>not</em> mean that a definition for a given symbol can be
omitted if there is an AssignmentRule object for it.  For example, there
must be a Parameter definition for a given parameter if there is an
AssignmentRule for that parameter.  It is only a question of which value
definition takes precedence.
@section general General summary of SBML rules
In SBML Level&nbsp;3 as well as Level&nbsp;2, rules are separated into three
subclasses for the benefit of model analysis software.  The three
subclasses are based on the following three different possible functional
forms (where <em>x</em> is a variable, <em>f</em> is some arbitrary
function returning a numerical result, <b><em>V</em></b> is a vector of
variables that does not include <em>x</em>, and <b><em>W</em></b> is a
vector of variables that may include <em>x</em>):
<center>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" style="font-size: small">
<tr><td width="120px"><em>Algebraic:</em></td><td width="250px">left-hand side is zero</td><td><em>0 = f(B<W>)</em></td></tr>

<tr><td><em>Rate:</em></td><td>left-hand side is a rate-of-change:</td><td><em>dx/dt = f(B<W>)</em></td></tr>
</table>
</center>
In their general form given above, there is little to distinguish
between <em>assignment</em> and <em>algebraic</em> rules.  They are treated as
separate cases for the following reasons:

=over


=item

<em>Assignment</em> rules can simply be evaluated to calculate
intermediate values for use in numerical methods.  They are statements
of equality that hold at all times.  (For assignments that are only
performed once, see InitialAssignment.)<p>

=item

SBML needs to place restrictions on assignment rules, for example
the restriction that assignment rules cannot contain algebraic loops.<p>

=item

Some simulators do not contain numerical solvers capable of solving
unconstrained algebraic equations, and providing more direct forms such
as assignment rules may enable those simulators to process models they
could not process if the same assignments were put in the form of
general algebraic equations;<p>

=item

Those simulators that <em>can</em> solve these algebraic equations make a
distinction between the different categories listed above; and<p>

=item

Some specialized numerical analyses of models may only be applicable
to models that do not contain <em>algebraic</em> rules.

=back


The approach taken to covering these cases in SBML is to define an
abstract Rule structure containing a subelement, "math", to hold the
right-hand side expression, then to derive subtypes of Rule that add
attributes to distinguish the cases of algebraic, assignment and rate
rules.  The "math" subelement must contain a MathML expression defining the
mathematical formula of the rule.  This MathML formula must return a
numerical value.  The formula can be an arbitrary expression referencing
the variables and other entities in an SBML model.
Each of the three subclasses of Rule (AssignmentRule, AlgebraicRule,
RateRule) inherit the the "math" subelement and other fields from SBase.
The AssignmentRule and RateRule classes add an additional attribute,
"variable".  See the definitions of AssignmentRule, AlgebraicRule and
RateRule for details about the structure and interpretation of each one.
@section additional-restrictions Additional restrictions on SBML rules
An important design goal of SBML rule semantics is to ensure that a
model's simulation and analysis results will not be dependent on when or
how often rules are evaluated.  To achieve this, SBML needs to place two
restrictions on rule use.  The first concerns algebraic loops in the system
of assignments in a model, and the second concerns overdetermined systems.
@subsection no-algebraic-loops A model must not contain algebraic loops
The combined set of InitialAssignment, AssignmentRule and KineticLaw
objects in a model constitute a set of assignment statements that should be
considered as a whole.  (A KineticLaw object is counted as an assignment
because it assigns a value to the symbol contained in the "id" attribute of
the Reaction object in which it is defined.)  This combined set of
assignment statements must not contain algebraic loops&mdash;dependency
chains between these statements must terminate.  To put this more formally,
consider a directed graph in which nodes are assignment statements and
directed arcs exist for each occurrence of an SBML species, compartment or
parameter symbol in an assignment statement's "math" subelement.  Let the
directed arcs point from the statement assigning the symbol to the
statements that contain the symbol in their "math" subelement expressions.
This graph must be acyclic.
SBML does not specify when or how often rules should be evaluated.
Eliminating algebraic loops ensures that assignment statements can be
evaluated any number of times without the result of those evaluations
changing.  As an example, consider the set of equations <em>x = x + 1</em>,
<em>y = z + 200</em> and <em>z = y + 100</em>.  If this set of equations
were interpreted as a set of assignment statements, it would be invalid
because the rule for <em>x</em> refers to <em>x</em> (exhibiting one type
of loop), and the rule for <em>y</em> refers to <em>z</em> while the rule
for <em>z</em> refers back to <em>y</em> (exhibiting another type of loop).
Conversely, the following set of equations would constitute a valid set of
assignment statements: <em>x = 10</em>, <em>y = z + 200</em>, and <em>z = x
+ 100</em>.
@subsection no-overdetermined A model must not be overdetermined
An SBML model must not be overdetermined; that is, a model must not
define more equations than there are unknowns in a model.  An SBML model
that does not contain AlgebraicRule structures cannot be overdetermined.
LibSBML implements the static analysis procedure described in Appendix
B of the SBML Level&nbsp;3 Version&nbsp;1 Core specification for assessing
whether a model is overdetermined.
(In summary, assessing whether a given continuous, deterministic,
mathematical model is overdetermined does not require dynamic analysis; it
can be done by analyzing the system of equations created from the model.
One approach is to construct a bipartite graph in which one set of vertices
represents the variables and the other the set of vertices represents the
equations.  Place edges between vertices such that variables in the system
are linked to the equations that determine them.  For algebraic equations,
there will be edges between the equation and each variable occurring in the
equation.  For ordinary differential equations (such as those defined by
rate rules or implied by the reaction rate definitions), there will be a
single edge between the equation and the variable determined by that
differential equation.  A mathematical model is overdetermined if the
maximal matchings of the bipartite graph contain disconnected vertexes
representing equations.  If one maximal matching has this property, then
all the maximal matchings will have this property; i.e., it is only
necessary to find one maximal matching.)
@section RuleType_t RuleType_t for SBML Level 1
SBML Level 1 uses a different scheme than SBML Level&nbsp;2 and
Level&nbsp;3 for distinguishing rules; specifically, it uses an attribute
whose value is drawn from an enumeration.  LibSBML supports this using
methods that work with the #RuleType_t enumeration.

=head2 RateRule

LibSBML implementation of SBML's RateRule construct.
The rule type RateRule is derived from the parent class Rule.  It is
used to express equations that determine the rates of change of
variables.  The left-hand side (the "variable" attribute) can refer to
the identifier of a species, compartment, or parameter (but not a
reaction).  The entity identified must have its "constant" attribute set
to C<false>.  The effects of a RateRule are in general terms the same,
but differ in the precise details depending on which variable is being
set:


=over
 
=item

<em>In the case of a species</em>, a RateRule sets the rate of
change of the species' quantity (<em>concentration</em> or <em>amount of
substance</em>) to the value determined by the formula in the "math"
subelement of the RateRule object.  The overall units of the formula in
"math" I<should> (in SBML Level&nbsp;2 Version&nbsp;4 and later) or @em
must (in SBML releases prior to Level&nbsp;2 version&nbsp;4) be equal to
the unit of <em>species quantity</em> divided by the model-wide unit of
<em>time</em>.  <em>Restrictions</em>: There must not be both a RateRule
"variable" attribute and a SpeciesReference "species" attribute having
the same value, unless that species has its "boundaryCondition"
attribute is set to C<true>.  This means a rate rule cannot be defined
for a species that is created or destroyed in a reaction, unless that
species is defined as a boundary condition in the model.

=item

(For SBML Level&nbsp;3 only) <em>In the case of a species
reference</em>, a RateRule sets the rate of change of the stoichiometry
of the referenced reactant or product to the value determined by the
formula in "math".  The unit associated with the value produced by the
"math" formula should be consistent with the unit "dimensionless"
divided by the model-wide unit of <em>time</em>.

=item

<em>In the case of a compartment</em>, a RateRule sets the rate of
change of the compartment's size to the value determined by the formula
in the "math" subelement of the RateRule object.  The overall units of
the formula I<should> (in SBML Level&nbsp;2 Version&nbsp;4 and
later) or I<must> (in SBML releases prior to Level&nbsp;2
version&nbsp;4) be the units of the compartment's <em>size</em> divided
by the model-wide unit of <em>time</em>.

=item

<em>In the case of a parameter</em>, a RateRule sets the rate of
change of the parameter's value to that determined by the formula in the
"math" subelement of the RateRule object.  The overall units of the
formula I<should> (in SBML Level&nbsp;2 Version&nbsp;4 and
later) or I<must> (in SBML releases prior to Level&nbsp;2
version&nbsp;4) be the Parameter object's "unit" attribute value divided
by the model-wide unit of <em>time</em>.

=back


In the context of a simulation, rate rules are in effect for simulation
time <em>t</em> &lt; <em>0</em>.  Please consult the relevant SBML
specification for additional information about the semantics of
assignments, rules, and entity values for simulation time <em>t</em>
\f$\leq\f$ <em>0</em>.
As mentioned in the description of AssignmentRule, a model must not
contain more than one RateRule or AssignmentRule object having the same
value of "variable"; in other words, in the set of all assignment rules
and rate rules in an SBML model, each variable appearing in the
left-hand sides can only appear once.  This simply follows from the fact
that an indeterminate system would result if a model contained more than
one assignment rule for the same variable or both an assignment rule and
a rate rule for the same variable.

=head2 ListOfRules

LibSBML implementation of SBML's ListOfRules construct.
The various ListOf___ classes in SBML are merely containers used for
organizing the main components of an SBML model.  All are derived from
the abstract class SBase, and inherit the various attributes and
subelements of SBase, such as "metaid" as and "annotation".  The
ListOf___ classes do not add any attributes of their own.
The relationship between the lists and the rest of an SBML model is
illustrated by the following (for SBML Level&nbsp;3 and later versions
of SBML Level&nbsp;2 as well):
@image html listof-illustration.jpg "ListOf___ elements in an SBML Model"
@image latex listof-illustration.jpg "ListOf___ elements in an SBML Model"
Readers may wonder about the motivations for using the ListOf___
containers.  A simpler approach in XML might be to place the components
all directly at the top level of the model definition.  We chose instead
to group them within XML elements named after ListOf<em>Classname</em>,
in part because we believe this helps organize the components and makes
visual reading of models in XML easier.  More importantly, the fact that
the container classes are derived from SBase means that software tools
can add information about the lists themselves into each list
container's "annotation".

Levels&nbsp;2 and&nbsp;3, the only two types of Rule objects with a
left-hand side object reference are AssignmentRule and RateRule, and
both of them use the same name for attribute: "variable".  In order to
make it easier for application developers to work with all Levels of
SBML, libSBML uses a uniform name for all such attributes, and it is
"variable", regardless of whether Level&nbsp;1 rules or
Level&nbsp;2&ndash;3 rules are being used.
@param sid the identifier of a Compartment, Species or Parameter

=item Rule::getDerivedUnitDefinition

Calculates and returns a UnitDefinition that expresses the units of
measurement assumed for the "math" expression of this Rule.
The units are calculated based on the mathematical expression in the
Rule and the model quantities referenced by C<&lt;ci&gt;>
elements used within that expression.  The getDerivedUnitDefinition()
method returns the calculated units.
Note that the functionality that facilitates unit analysis depends 
on the model as a whole.  Thus, in cases where the object has not 
been added to a model or the model itself is incomplete,
unit analysis is not possible and this method will return C<NULL>.
@warning Note that it is possible the "math" expression in the Rule
contains pure numbers or parameters with undeclared units.  In those
cases, it is not possible to calculate the units of the overall
expression without making assumptions.  LibSBML does not make
assumptions about the units, and getDerivedUnitDefinition() only
returns the units as far as it is able to determine them.  For
example, in an expression <em>X + Y</em>, if <em>X</em> has
unambiguously-defined units and <em>Y</em> does not, it will return
the units of <em>X</em>.  <strong>It is important that callers also
invoke the method</strong> containsUndeclaredUnits() <strong>to
determine whether this situation holds</strong>.  Callers may wish to
take suitable actions in those scenarios.
Returns a UnitDefinition that expresses the units of the math 
expression of this Rule, or C<NULL> if one cannot be constructed.

=head2 Constraint

LibSBML implementation of SBML's Constraint construct.
The Constraint object class was introduced in SBML Level&nbsp;2 Version&nbsp;2 as
a mechanism for stating the assumptions under which a model is designed
to operate.  The <em>constraints</em> are statements about permissible
values of different quantities in a model.  Constraints are not used to
compute dynamical values for simulation or analysis, but rather, they
serve an advisory role for simulation/analysis tools.
SBML's Constraint object class has one required attribute, "id", to
give the parameter a unique identifier by which other parts of an SBML
model definition can refer to it.  A Constraint object can also have an
optional "name" attribute of type C<string>.  Identifiers and names must
be used according to the guidelines described in the SBML specification
(e.g., Section 3.3 in the Level&nbsp;2 Version 4 specification).  
Constraint has one required subelement, "math", containing a MathML
formula defining the condition of the constraint.  This formula must
return a boolean value of C<true> when the model is a <em>valid</em>
state.  The formula can be an arbitrary expression referencing the
variables and other entities in an SBML model.  The evaluation of "math"
and behavior of constraints are described in more detail below.
A Constraint structure also has an optional subelement called "message".
This can contain a message in XHTML format that may be displayed to the
user when the condition of the formula in the "math" subelement
evaluates to a value of C<false>.  Software tools are not required to
display the message, but it is recommended that they do so as a matter
of best practice.  The XHTML content within a "message" subelement must
follow the same restrictions as for the "notes" element on SBase
described in in the SBML Level&nbsp;2 specification.  For example, "message"
must not contain an XML declaration or a DOCTYPE declaration, and the
permitted content can only take one of the following general forms: (1)
a complete XHTML document beginning with the element
C<&lt;html&gt;> and ending with C<&lt;/xhtml&gt;>; 
(2) the body portion of a document beginning with the element
C<&lt;body&gt;> and ending with C<&lt;/body&gt;>; or
(3) XHTML content that is permitted within a C<&lt;body&gt;> ...
C<&lt;/body&gt;> elements.  The appendix of the SBML Level&nbsp;2
Version 4 specification document describes one approach to reading the
"message" subelement content.
Constraint was introduced in SBML Level&nbsp;2 Version&nbsp;2.  It is not
available in earlier versions of Level&nbsp;2 nor in any version of Level&nbsp;1.
@section constraint-semantics Semantics of Constraints
In the context of a simulation, a Constraint has effect at all times
<em>t \f$\geq\f$ 0</em>.  Each Constraint's "math" subelement is first
evaluated after any InitialAssignment definitions in a model at <em>t =
0</em> and can conceivably trigger at that point.  (In other words, a
simulation could fail a constraint immediately.)
Constraint structures <em>cannot and should not</em> be used to compute
the dynamical behavior of a model as part of, for example, simulation.
Constraints may be used as input to non-dynamical analysis, for instance
by expressing flux constraints for flux balance analysis.
The results of a simulation of a model containing a constraint are
invalid from any simulation time at and after a point when the function
given by the "math" subelement returns a value of C<false>.  Invalid
simulation results do not make a prediction of the behavior of the
biochemical reaction network represented by the model.  The precise
behavior of simulation tools is left undefined with respect to
constraints.  If invalid results are detected with respect to a given
constraint, the "message" subelement may optionally be displayed to the
user.  The simulation tool may also halt the simulation or clearly
delimit in output data the simulation time point at which the simulation
results become invalid.
SBML does not impose restrictions on duplicate Constraint definitions or
the order of evaluation of Constraint objects in a model.  It is
possible for a model to define multiple constraints all with the same
mathematical expression.  Since the failure of any constraint indicates
that the model simulation has entered an invalid state, a system is not
required to attempt to detect whether other constraints in the model
have failed once any one constraint has failed.

=head2 ListOfConstraints

LibSBML implementation of SBML's ListOfConstraints construct.
The various ListOf___ classes in SBML are merely containers used for
organizing the main components of an SBML model.  All are derived from
the abstract class SBase, and inherit the various attributes and
subelements of SBase, such as "metaid" as and "annotation".  The
ListOf___ classes do not add any attributes of their own.
The relationship between the lists and the rest of an SBML model is
illustrated by the following (for SBML Level&nbsp;2 Version&nbsp;4):
@image html listof-illustration.jpg "ListOf___ elements in an SBML Model"
@image latex listof-illustration.jpg "ListOf___ elements in an SBML Model"
Readers may wonder about the motivations for using the ListOf___
containers.  A simpler approach in XML might be to place the components
all directly at the top level of the model definition.  We chose instead
to group them within XML elements named after ListOf<em>Classname</em>,
in part because we believe this helps organize the components and makes
visual reading of models in XML easier.  More importantly, the fact that
the container classes are derived from SBase means that software tools
can add information about the lists themselves into each list
container's "annotation".

=head2 Reaction

LibSBML implementation of SBML's Reaction construct.
A I<reaction> represents any transformation, transport or binding
process, typically a chemical reaction, that can change the quantity of
one or more species.  In SBML, a reaction is defined primarily in terms
of the participating reactants and products (and their corresponding
stoichiometries), along with optional modifier species, an optional rate
at which the reaction takes place, and optional parameters.  
As with other major object in SBML, Reaction has a mandatory attribute,
"id", used to give the compartment type an identifier.  The identifier
must be a text string conforming to the identifer syntax permitted in
SBML.  In SBML Level&nbsp;2 and Level&nbsp;3, the reaction "id"
identifier can be used in mathematical formulas elsewhere in an SBML
model to represent the rate of that reaction; this usage is explained
below.  Reaction also has an optional "name" attribute, of type @c
string.  The "id" and "name" must be used according to the guidelines
described in the SBML specification.
The species participating as reactants, products, and/or modifiers in a
reaction are declared using lists of SpeciesReference and/or
ModifierSpeciesReference instances stored in subelements
"listOfReactants", "listOfProducts" and "listOfModifiers".  Certain
restrictions are placed on the appearance of species in reaction
definitions:

=over


=item

The ability of a species to appear as a reactant or product of any
reaction in a model is governed by certain flags in that species'
definition; see the definition of Species for more information.

=item

Any species appearing in the mathematical formula of the subelement
"kineticLaw" (described below) of a Reaction must be declared in at
least one of that Reaction's lists of reactants, products, and/or
modifiers.  Put another way, it is an error for a reaction's kinetic law
formula to refer to species that have not been declared for that
reaction.


=item

A reaction definition can contain an empty list of reactants
<em>or</em> an empty list of products, but it must have at least one
reactant or product; in other words, a reaction without any reactant or
product species is not permitted.  (This restriction does not apply to
modifier species, which remain optional in all cases.)

=back


A reaction can contain up to one KineticLaw object in a subelement named
"kineticLaw".  It defines the speed at which the process defined by the
reaction takes place.  The description of KineticLaw provides more
details about its use.  Note that although the inclusion of a KineticLaw
object in an instance of a Reaction component is optional, there is no
useful default that can be substituted in place of a missing rate
expression in a reaction.  Moreover, a reaction's rate cannot be defined
in any other way in SBML&mdash;InitialAssignment, AssignmentRule,
RateRule, AlgebraicRule, Event, and other constructs in SBML cannot be
used to set the reaction rate separately.  Nevertheless, for some
modeling applications, reactions without any defined rate can be
perfectly acceptable.
Reaction also has a boolean attribute named "reversible" for indicating
whether the reaction is reversible.  This attribute is optional in SBML
Level&nbsp;2, with a default of C<true>; it is mandatory in SBML
Level&nbsp;3 (with no default value).  To say that a reaction is @em
reversible is to say it can proceed in either the forward or the reverse
direction.  Although the reversibility of a reaction can sometimes be
deduced by inspecting its rate expression, this is not always the case,
especially for complicated expressions.  Moreover, the need in SBML to
allow rate expressions (i.e., KineticLaw) to be optional leads to the
need for a separate flag indicating reversibility.  Note that labeling a
reaction as irreversible is an assertion that the reaction always
proceeds in the given forward direction.  (Why else would it be flagged
as irreversible?)  This implies the rate expression in the KineticLaw
always has a non-negative value during simulations.  Software tools
could provide a means of optionally testing that this condition holds.
The presence of reversibility information in two places (i.e., the rate
expression and the "reversible" attribute on Reaction) leaves open the
possibility that a model could contain contradictory information, but
the creation of such a model would be an error on the part of the
software generating it.
The Reaction object class has another boolean attribute called "fast".
This attribute is optional in SBML Level&nbsp;2, with a default of @c
false; it is mandatory in SBML Level&nbsp;3 (with no default value).  It
is used to indicate that a reaction occurs on a vastly faster time scale
than others in a system.  Readers are directed to the SBML Level&nbsp;2
Version&nbsp;4 specification, which provides more detail about the
conditions under which a reaction can be considered to be fast in this
sense.  The attribute's default value is C<false>.  SBML Level&nbsp;1
and Level&nbsp;2 Version&nbsp;1 incorrectly claimed that software tools
could ignore this attribute if they did not implement support for the
corresponding concept; however, further research in SBML has revealed
that this is not true, and "fast" <em>cannot be ignored</em> if it is
set to C<true>.  SBML Level&nbsp;2 Versions&nbsp;2&ndash;4 therefore
stipulate that if a model has any reactions with "fast" set to C<true>,
a software tool must be able to respect the attribute or else indicate
to the user that it does not have the capacity to do so.  Analysis
software cannot ignore the value of the "fast" attribute because doing
so may lead to different results as compared to a software system that
<em>does</em> make use of "fast".
In SBML Level&nbsp;3 Version&nbsp;1, the Reaction object has an
additional optional attribute named "compartment", whose value must be
the identifier of a compartment defined in the enclosing Model object.
The "compartment" attribute can be used to indicate the compartment in
which the reaction is assumed to take place.  If the attribute is
present, its value must be the identifier of a Compartment object
defined in the enclosing Model object.  Similar to the "reversible"
attribute, the value of the "compartment" attribute has no direct impact
on the construction of mathematical equations for the SBML model.  When
a kinetic law is given for a reaction, the compartment location may
already be implicit in the kinetic law (although this cannot always be
guaranteed).  Nevertheless, software tools may find the "compartment"
attribute value useful for such purposes as analyzing the structure of
the model, guiding the modeler in constructing correct rate formulas,
and visualization purposes.
Readers are urged to read the SBML specification for more details about
the proper use of Reaction.

=head2 ListOfReactions

LibSBML implementation of SBML's ListOfReactions construct.
The various ListOf___ classes in SBML are merely containers used for
organizing the main components of an SBML model.  All are derived from
the abstract class SBase, and inherit the various attributes and
subelements of SBase, such as "metaid" as and "annotation".  The
ListOf___ classes do not add any attributes of their own.
The relationship between the lists and the rest of an SBML model is
illustrated by the following (for SBML Level&nbsp;2 Version&nbsp;4):
@image html listof-illustration.jpg "ListOf___ elements in an SBML Model"
@image latex listof-illustration.jpg "ListOf___ elements in an SBML Model"
Readers may wonder about the motivations for using the ListOf___
containers.  A simpler approach in XML might be to place the components
all directly at the top level of the model definition.  We chose instead
to group them within XML elements named after ListOf<em>Classname</em>,
in part because we believe this helps organize the components and makes
visual reading of models in XML easier.  More importantly, the fact that
the container classes are derived from SBase means that software tools
can add information about the lists themselves into each list
container's "annotation".

=head2 KineticLaw

LibSBML implementation of SBML's KineticLaw construct.
An object of class KineticLaw is used to describe the rate at which the
process defined by a given Reaction takes place.  KineticLaw has
subelements called "math" (for MathML content) and "listOfParameters"
(of class ListOfParameters), in addition to the attributes and
subelements it inherits from SBase.
KineticLaw's "math" subelement for holding a MathML formula defines the
rate of the reaction.  The formula may refer to other entities in a
model (Compartment, Species, Parameter, FunctionDefinition, Reaction),
but the only Species identifiers that can be used in this formula are
those declared in the lists of reactants, products and modifiers in the
Reaction structure.  Parameter identifiers may be taken from either the
KineticLaw's list of local parameters (discussed below) or the
parameters defined globally on the Model instance.
KineticLaw also provides a way to define I<local> parameters whose
identifiers can be used in the "math" formula of that KineticLaw
instance.  Prior to SBML Level&nbsp;3, these parameter definitions are
stored inside a "listOfParameters" subelement containing Parameter
objects; in SBML Level&nbsp;3, this is achieved using a specialized
object class called LocalParameter and the containing subelement is
called "listOfLocalParameters".  In both cases, the parameters so
defined are only visible within the KineticLaw; they cannot be accessed
outside.  A local parameter within one reaction is not visible from
within another, nor is it visible to any other construct outside of the
KineticLaw in which it is defined.  In addition, another important
feature is that if such a Parameter (or in Level&nbsp;3, LocalParameter)
object has the same identifier as another object in the scope of the
enclosing Model, the definition inside the KineticLaw takes precedence.
In other words, within the KineticLaw's "math" formula, references to
local parameter identifiers <strong>shadow any identical global
identifiers</strong>.

The values of local parameters defined within KineticLaw objects cannot
change.  In SBML Level&nbsp;3, this quality is built into the
LocalParameter construct.  In Level&nbsp;2, where the same kind of
Parameter object class is used as for global parameters, the Parameter
objects' "constant" attribute must always have a value of C<true>
(either explicitly or left to its default value).
@note Before SBML Level&nbsp;2 Version&nbsp;2, the SBML specification
included two additional attributes on KineticLaw called "substanceUnits"
and "timeUnits".  They were removed beginning with SBML Level&nbsp;2
Version&nbsp;2 because further research determined they introduced many
problems.  The most significant problem was that their use could easily
lead to the creation of valid models whose reactions nevertheless could
not be integrated into a system of equations without outside knowledge
for converting the quantities used.  Examination of real-life models
revealed that a common reason for using "substanceUnits" on KineticLaw
was to set the units of all reactions to the same set of substance
units, something that is better achieved by using UnitDefinition to
redefine C<"substance"> for the whole Model.

=item KineticLaw::KineticLaw

Creates a new KineticLaw using the given SBML C<level> and C<version>
values.

@param level an unsigned int, the SBML Level to assign to this KineticLaw
@param version an unsigned int, the SBML Version to assign to this
KineticLaw

@note Upon the addition of a KineticLaw object to an SBMLDocument
(e.g., using Model::addKineticLaw()), the SBML Level, SBML Version
and XML namespace of the document I<override> the values used
when creating the KineticLaw object via this constructor.  This is
necessary to ensure that an SBML document is a consistent structure.
Nevertheless, the ability to supply the values at the time of creation
of a KineticLaw is an important aid to producing valid SBML.  Knowledge
of the intented SBML Level and Version determine whether it is valid
to assign a particular value to an attribute, or whether it is valid
to add an object to an existing SBMLDocument.


=item KineticLaw::KineticLaw

Creates a new KineticLaw using the given SBMLNamespaces object
C<sbmlns>.
The SBMLNamespaces object encapsulates SBML Level/Version/namespaces
information.  It is used to communicate the SBML Level, Version, and
(in Level&nbsp;3) packages used in addition to SBML Level&nbsp;3 Core.
A common approach to using this class constructor is to create an
SBMLNamespaces object somewhere in a program, once, then pass it to
object constructors such as this one when needed.
@param sbmlns an SBMLNamespaces object.

getDerivedUnitDefinition() method returns the calculated units.
Note that the functionality that facilitates unit analysis depends

unit analysis is not possible and this method will return C<NULL>.
@warning Note that it is possible the "math" expression in the
KineticLaw contains pure numbers or parameters with undeclared
units.  In those cases, it is not possible to calculate the units of
the overall expression without making assumptions.  LibSBML does not
make assumptions about the units, and getDerivedUnitDefinition() only
returns the units as far as it is able to determine them.  For
example, in an expression <em>X + Y</em>, if <em>X</em> has
unambiguously-defined units and <em>Y</em> does not, it will return
the units of <em>X</em>.  <strong>It is important that callers also
invoke the method</strong> containsUndeclaredUnits() <strong>to

=head2 SimpleSpeciesReference

LibSBML implementation of SBML's SimpleSpeciesReference construct.
As mentioned in the description of Reaction, every species that enters
into a given reaction must appear in that reaction's lists of reactants,
products and/or modifiers.  In an SBML model, all species that may
participate in any reaction are listed in the "listOfSpecies" element of
the top-level Model object.  Lists of products, reactants and modifiers
in Reaction objects do not introduce new species, but rather, they refer
back to those listed in the model's top-level "listOfSpecies".  For
reactants and products, the connection is made using SpeciesReference
objects; for modifiers, it is made using ModifierSpeciesReference
objects.  SimpleSpeciesReference is an abstract type that serves as the
parent class of both SpeciesReference and ModifierSpeciesReference.  It
is used simply to hold the attributes and elements that are common to
the latter two structures.
The SimpleSpeciesReference structure has a mandatory attribute,
"species", which must be a text string conforming to the identifer
syntax permitted in SBML.  This attribute is inherited by the
SpeciesReference and ModifierSpeciesReference subclasses derived from
SimpleSpeciesReference.  The value of the "species" attribute must be
the identifier of a species defined in the enclosing Model.  The species
is thereby declared as participating in the reaction being defined.  The
precise role of that species as a reactant, product, or modifier in the
reaction is determined by the subclass of SimpleSpeciesReference (i.e.,
either SpeciesReference or ModifierSpeciesReference) in which the
identifier appears.
SimpleSpeciesReference also contains an optional attribute, "id",
allowing instances to be referenced from other structures.  No SBML
structures currently do this; however, such structures are anticipated
in future SBML Levels.
<!---------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

=head2 SpeciesReference

LibSBML implementation of SBML's SpeciesReference construct.
The Reaction structure provides a way to express which species act as
reactants and which species act as products in a reaction.  In a given
reaction, references to those species acting as reactants and/or
products are made using instances of SpeciesReference structures in a
Reaction object's lists of reactants and products.
A species can occur more than once in the lists of reactants and
products of a given Reaction instance.  The effective stoichiometry for
a species in a reaction is the sum of the stoichiometry values given on
the SpeciesReference object in the list of products minus the sum of
stoichiometry values given on the SpeciesReference objects in the list
of reactants.  A positive value indicates the species is effectively a
product and a negative value indicates the species is effectively a
reactant.  SBML places no restrictions on the effective stoichiometry of
a species in a reaction; for example, it can be zero.  In the following
SBML fragment, the two reactions have the same effective stoichiometry
for all their species:
C<ode>
<reaction id="x">
<listOfReactants>
<speciesReference species="a"/>
<speciesReference species="a"/>
<speciesReference species="b"/>
</listOfReactants>
<listOfProducts>
<speciesReference species="c"/>
<speciesReference species="b"/>
</listProducts>
</reaction>
<reaction id="y">
<listOfReactants>
<speciesReference species="a" stoichiometry="2"/>
</listOfReactants>
<listOfProducts>
<speciesReference species="c"/>
</listProducts>
</reaction>
@endcode

The precise structure of SpeciesReference differs between SBML
Level&nbsp;2 and Level&nbsp;3.  We discuss the two variants in separate
sections below.
@section spr-l2 SpeciesReference in SBML Level 2
The mandatory "species" attribute of SpeciesReference must have as its
value the identifier of an existing species defined in the enclosing
Model.  The species is thereby designated as a reactant or product in
the reaction.  Which one it is (i.e., reactant or product) is indicated
by whether the SpeciesReference appears in the Reaction's "reactant" or
"product" lists.
Product and reactant stoichiometries can be specified using
<em>either</em> "stoichiometry" or "stoichiometryMath" in a
SpeciesReference object.  The "stoichiometry" attribute is of type
double and should contain values greater than zero (0).  The
"stoichiometryMath" element is implemented as an element containing a
MathML expression.  These two are mutually exclusive; only one of
"stoichiometry" or "stoichiometryMath" should be defined in a given
SpeciesReference instance.  When neither the attribute nor the element
is present, the value of "stoichiometry" in the SpeciesReference
instance defaults to C<1>.
For maximum interoperability, the "stoichiometry" attribute should be
used in preference to "stoichiometryMath" when a species' stoichiometry
is a simple scalar number (integer or decimal).  When the stoichiometry
is a rational number, or when it is a more complicated formula,
"stoichiometryMath" must be used.  The MathML expression in
"stoichiometryMath" may also refer to identifiers of entities in a model
(except reaction identifiers).  However, the only species identifiers
that can be used in "stoichiometryMath" are those referenced in the
Reaction list of reactants, products and modifiers.
The following is a simple example of a species reference for species @c
X0, with stoichiometry C<2>, in a list of reactants within a reaction
having the identifier C<J1>:
C<ode>
<model>
...
<listOfReactions>
<reaction id="J1">
<listOfReactants>
<speciesReference species="X0" stoichiometry="2">
</listOfReactants>
...
</reaction>
...
</listOfReactions>
...
</model>
@endcode
The following is a more complex example of a species reference for
species X0, with a stoichiometry formula consisting of the parameter
C<x>:
C<ode>
<model>
...
<listOfReactions>
<reaction id="J1">
<listOfReactants>
<speciesReference species="X0">
<stoichiometryMath>
<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">

</listOfReactions>

</model>
@endcode
@section spr-l3 SpeciesReference in SBML Level 3
In Level 2's definition of a reaction, the stoichiometry attribute of a
SpeciesReference is actually a combination of two factors, the standard
biochemical stoichiometry and a conversion factor that may be needed to
translate the units of the species quantity to the units of the reaction
rate. Unfortunately, Level&nbsp;2 offers no direct way of decoupling
these two factors, or for explicitly indicating the units. The only way
to do it in Level&nbsp;2 is to use the StoichiometryMath object
associated with SpeciesReferences, and to reference SBML Parameter
objects from within the StoichiometryMath formula. This works because
Parameter offers a way to attach units to a numerical value, but the
solution is indirect and awkward for something that should be a simple
matter.  Moreover, the question of how to properly encode
stoichiometries in SBML reactions has caused much confusion among
implementors of SBML software.
SBML Level&nbsp;3 approaches this problem differently.  It (1) extends
the the use of the SpeciesReference identifier to represent the value of
the "stoichiometry" attribute, (2) makes the "stoichiometry" attribute
optional, (3) removes StoichiometryMath, and (4) adds a new "constant"
boolean attribute on SpeciesReference.
As in Level&nbsp;2, the "stoichiometry" attribute is of type
C<double> and should contain values greater than zero (C<0>).  A
missing "stoichiometry" implies that the stoichiometry is either
unknown, or to be obtained from an external source, or determined by an
InitialAssignment object or other SBML construct elsewhere in the model.
A species reference's stoichiometry is set by its "stoichiometry"
attribute exactly once.  If the SpeciesReference object's "constant"
attribute has the value C<true>, then the stoichiometry is fixed and
cannot be changed except by an InitialAssignment object.  These two
methods of setting the stoichiometry (i.e., using "stoichiometry"
directly, or using InitialAssignment) differ in that the "stoichiometry"
attribute can only be set to a literal floating-point number, whereas
InitialAssignment allows the value to be set using an arbitrary
mathematical expression.  (As an example, the approach could be used to
set the stoichiometry to a rational number of the form I<p>/I<q>,
where I<p> and I<q> are integers, something that is occasionally
useful in the context of biochemical reaction networks.)  If the species
reference's "constant" attribute has the value C<false>, the species
reference's value may be overridden by an InitialAssignment or changed
by AssignmentRule or AlgebraicRule, and in addition, for simulation time
<em>t &gt; 0</em>, it may also be changed by a RateRule or Event
objects.  (However, some of these constructs are mutually exclusive; see
the SBML Level&nbsp;3 Version&nbsp;1 Core specifiation for more
details.)  It is not an error to define "stoichiometry" on a species
reference and also redefine the stoichiometry using an
InitialAssignment, but the "stoichiometry" attribute in that case is
ignored.

The value of the "id" attribute of a SpeciesReference can be used as the
content of a C<&lt;ci&gt;> element in MathML formulas
elsewhere in the model.  When the identifier appears in a MathML
C<&lt;ci&gt;> element, it represents the stoichiometry of the
corresponding species in the reaction where the SpeciesReference object
instance appears.  More specifically, it represents the value of the
"stoichiometry" attribute on the SpeciesReference object.
In SBML Level 3, the unit of measurement associated with the value of a
species' stoichiometry is always considered to be C<dimensionless>.
This has the following implications:

=over



=item

When a species reference's identifier appears in mathematical
formulas elsewhere in the model, the unit associated with that value is
C<dimensionless>.

=item

The units of the "math" elements of AssignmentRule,
InitialAssignment and EventAssignment objects setting the stoichiometry
of the species reference should be C<dimensionless>.

=item

If a species reference's identifier is the subject of a RateRule,
the unit associated with the RateRule object's value should be
C<dimensionless>/<em>time</em>, where <em>time</em> is the
model-wide unit of time set on the Model object.

=head2 ModifierSpeciesReference

LibSBML implementation of SBML's ModifierSpeciesReference construct.
Sometimes a species appears in the kinetic rate formula of a reaction
but is itself neither created nor destroyed in that reaction (for
example, because it acts as a catalyst or inhibitor).  In SBML, all such
species are simply called I<modifiers> without regard to the detailed
role of those species in the model.  The Reaction structure provides a
way to express which species act as modifiers in a given reaction.  This
is the purpose of the list of modifiers available in Reaction.  The list
contains instances of ModifierSpeciesReference structures.
The ModifierSpeciesReference structure inherits the mandatory attribute
"species" and optional attributes "id" and "name" from the parent class
SimpleSpeciesReference.  See the description of SimpleSpeciesReference
for more information about these.
The value of the "species" attribute must be the identifier of a species
defined in the enclosing Model; this species is designated as a modifier
for the current reaction.  A reaction may have any number of modifiers.
It is permissible for a modifier species to appear simultaneously in the
list of reactants and products of the same reaction where it is
designated as a modifier, as well as to appear in the list of reactants,
products and modifiers of other reactions in the model.

ListOfSpeciesReferences is merely a container used for organizing
instances of other objects, in this case SpeciesReference objects.
ListOfSpeciesReferences is derived from the abstract class SBase, and
inherit the various attributes and subelements of SBase, such as
"metaid" as and "annotation".  The ListOf___ classes do not add any
attributes of their own.

=item SpeciesReference::SpeciesReference

Creates a new SpeciesReference using the given SBML C<level> and C<version>
values.

@param level an unsigned int, the SBML Level to assign to this SpeciesReference
@param version an unsigned int, the SBML Version to assign to this
SpeciesReference

@note Upon the addition of a SpeciesReference object to an
SBMLDocument (e.g., using Model::addSpeciesReference()), the SBML
Level, SBML Version and XML namespace of the document @em
override the values used when creating the SpeciesReference object via
this constructor.  This is necessary to ensure that an SBML document
is a consistent structure.  Nevertheless, the ability to supply the
values at the time of creation of a SpeciesReference is an important
aid to producing valid SBML.  Knowledge of the intented SBML Level and
Version determine whether it is valid to assign a particular value to
an attribute, or whether it is valid to add an object to an existing
SBMLDocument.



=item SpeciesReference::SpeciesReference

Creates a new SpeciesReference using the given SBMLNamespaces object
C<sbmlns>.
@param sbmlns an SBMLNamespaces object.
@note Upon the addition of a SpeciesReference object to an
SBMLDocument (e.g., using Model::addSpeciesReference()), the SBML XML
namespace of the document I<overrides> the value used when creating
the SpeciesReference object via this constructor.  This is necessary

Returns a (deep) copy of this SpeciesReference.


=item SpeciesReference::initDefaults

Initializes the fields of this SpeciesReference object to "typical"
default values.
The SBML SpeciesReference component has slightly different aspects and
default attribute values in different SBML Levels and Versions.
This method sets the values to certain common defaults, based
mostly on what they are in SBML Level&nbsp;2.  Specifically:

=over


=item

Sets attribute "stoichiometry" to C<1>.0

=item

(Applies to Level&nbsp;1 models only) Sets attribute "denominator" to C<1>

=item SpeciesReference::getStoichiometry

Get the value of the "stoichiometry" attribute.
In SBML Level 2, product and reactant stoichiometries can be specified
using <em>either</em> "stoichiometry" or "stoichiometryMath" in a
SpeciesReference object.  The former is to be used when a
stoichiometry is simply a scalar number, while the latter is for
occasions when it needs to be a rational number or it needs to
reference other mathematical expressions.  The "stoichiometry"
attribute is of type C<double> and should contain values greater than
zero (C<0>).  The "stoichiometryMath" element is implemented as an
element containing a MathML expression.  These two are mutually
exclusive; only one of "stoichiometry" or "stoichiometryMath" should
be defined in a given SpeciesReference instance.  When neither the
attribute nor the element is present, the value of "stoichiometry" in
the SpeciesReference instance defaults to C<1>.  For maximum
interoperability between different software tools, the "stoichiometry"
attribute should be used in preference to "stoichiometryMath" when a
species' stoichiometry is a simple scalar number (integer or
decimal).

In SBML Level 3, there is no StoichiometryMath, and SpeciesReference
objects have only the "stoichiometry" attribute.
Returns the value of the (scalar) "stoichiometry" attribute of this
SpeciesReference.

The "stoichiometryMath" element exists only in SBML Level 2.  There,
product and reactant stoichiometries can be specified using
<em>either</em> "stoichiometry" or "stoichiometryMath" in a
SpeciesReference object.  The former is to be used when a
stoichiometry is simply a scalar number, while the latter is for
occasions when it needs to be a rational number or it needs to

=item SpeciesReference::getDenominator

Get the value of the "denominator" attribute, for the case of a
rational-numbered stoichiometry or a model in SBML Level&nbsp;1.
The "denominator" attribute is only actually written out in the case
of an SBML Level&nbsp;1 model.  In SBML Level&nbsp;2, rational-number
stoichiometries are written as MathML elements in the
"stoichiometryMath" subelement.  However, as a convenience to users,
libSBML allows the creation and manipulation of rational-number
stoichiometries by supplying the numerator and denominator directly
rather than having to manually create an ASTNode structure.  LibSBML
will write out the appropriate constructs (either a combination of
"stoichiometry" and "denominator" in the case of SBML Level&nbsp;1, or a

=head2 Event

LibSBML implementation of SBML's Event construct.
An Event object defines when the event can occur, the variables that are
affected by the event, and how the variables are affected.
An Event definition has several parts: an optional identifier (defined
by the attribute "id"), an optional name (defined by the attribute
"name"), a required trigger condition (defined by an object of class
Trigger), and at least one EventAssignment.  In addition, an event can
include an optional delay (defined by an object of class Delay).
The operation of Event is divided into two phases (even when the event
is not delayed): one when the event is I<fired>, and the other when the
event is I<executed>.  Trigger objects define the conditions for firing
an event, Delay objects define when the event is actually executed, and
EventAssignment objects define the effects of executing the event.
Please consult the descriptions of Trigger, Delay and EventAssignment
for more information.
The optional Delay on Event means there are two times to consider when
computing the results of an event: the time at which the event
<em>fires</em>, and the time at which assignments are <em>executed</em>.
It is also possible to distinguish between the time at which the
EventAssignment's expression is calculated, and the time at which the
assignment is made: the expression could be evaluated at the same time
the assignments are performed, i.e., when the event is
<em>executed</em>, but it could also be defined to be evaluated at the
time the event <em>fired</em>.
In SBML Level&nbsp;2 versions before Version&nbsp;4, the semantics of
Event time delays were defined such that the expressions in the event's
assignments were always evaluated at the time the event was
<em>fired</em>.  This definition made it difficult to define an event
whose assignment formulas were meant to be evaluated at the time the
event was <em>executed</em> (i.e., after the time period defined by the
value of the Delay element).  In SBML Level&nbsp;2 Version&nbsp;4 and in
Level&nbsp;3, the attribute "useValuesFromTriggerTime" on Event allows a
model to indicate the time at which the event's assignments are intended
the values of the assignment formulas are computed at the moment the
event fired, not after the delay.  If "useValuesFromTriggerTime"=@c
false, it means that the formulas in the event's assignments are to be
computed I<after> the delay, at the time the event is executed.
@section version-diffs SBML version differences
The definition of Event in SBML Level&nbsp;2 Versions 1 and 2 includes
an additional attribute called "timeUnits", which allowed the time units
of the Delay to be set explicitly.  Later Versions of SBML Level&nbsp;2
as well as SBML Level&nbsp;3 do not define this attribute.  LibSBML
supports this attribute for compatibility with previous versions of SBML
Level&nbsp;2; however, if a model in SBML Level&nbsp;3 or Level&nbsp;2
Versions&nbsp;3&ndash;4 format sets the attribute, the
consistency-checking method SBMLDocument::checkConsistency() will report
an error.
The attribute "useValuesFromTriggerTime" was introduced in SBML
Level&nbsp;2 Version&nbsp;4.  Models defined in prior Versions of SBML
Level&nbsp;2 cannot use this attribute, and
SBMLDocument::checkConsistency() will report an error if they do.

=head2 ListOfEvents

LibSBML implementation of SBML's ListOfEvents construct.
The various ListOf___ classes in SBML are merely containers used for
organizing the main components of an SBML model.  All are derived from
the abstract class SBase, and inherit the various attributes and
subelements of SBase, such as "metaid" as and "annotation".  The
ListOf___ classes do not add any attributes of their own.
The relationship between the lists and the rest of an SBML model is
illustrated by the following (for SBML Level&nbsp;2 Version&nbsp;4):
@image html listof-illustration.jpg "ListOf___ elements in an SBML Model"
@image latex listof-illustration.jpg "ListOf___ elements in an SBML Model"
Readers may wonder about the motivations for using the ListOf___
containers.  A simpler approach in XML might be to place the components
all directly at the top level of the model definition.  We chose instead
to group them within XML elements named after ListOf<em>Classname</em>,
in part because we believe this helps organize the components and makes
visual reading of models in XML easier.  More importantly, the fact that
the container classes are derived from SBase means that software tools
can add information about the lists themselves into each list
container's "annotation".

existing SBMLDocument.


=item Event::Event

Creates a new Event using the given SBMLNamespaces object

The SBMLNamespaces object encapsulates SBML Level/Version/namespaces
information.  It is used to communicate the SBML Level, Version, and

A common approach to using this class constructor is to create an
SBMLNamespaces object somewhere in a program, once, then pass it to
object constructors such as this one when needed.
@param sbmlns an SBMLNamespaces object.

=head2 EventAssignment

LibSBML implementation of SBML's EventAssignment construct for Event
An Event object defines when the event can occur, the variables that are
affected by the event, and how the variables are affected.  The purpose
of the EventAssignment object class is to define how variables are
affected by an Event.  In every instance of an Event definition in a
model, the object's ListOfEventAssignments must have a non-empty list of
one or more elements of class EventAssignment.
The operation of an Event is divided into two phases (regardless of
whether a delay is involved): one phase when the event is I<fired>, and
the other when the event is I<executed>.  EventAssignment objects are
interpreted when an event is executed.  The effects are described below.
EventAssignment is derived from SBase and adds one attribute
("variable") and one subelement ("math", containing MathML content).
The attribute "variable" is required to have a value.  Its type is the
SBML type C<SId> and can contain the identifier of an existing
Compartment, Species or (global) Parameter instance defined in the
model.

@section event-variable Effects of event assignments
An SBML event assignment has effect when the event is I<executed>; that
is, at the end of any given delay period (if defined) following the
moment that the Event is triggered.  When the event fires, the effect is
to change the value of the model component identified by the "variable"
attribute.

Certain restrictions are placed on what can appear in "variable":

=over


=item

The object identified by the value of the EventAssignment attribute
"variable" must not have its "constant" attribute set to or default to
C<true>.  (Constants cannot be affected by events.)

=item

The "variable" attribute must not contain the identifier of a
reaction; only species, compartment and parameter values may be set by
an Event.

=item

The value of every "variable" attribute must be unique among the set
of EventAssignment structures within a given Event structure.  In other
words, a single event cannot have multiple EventAssignment objects
assigning the same variable.  (All of them would be performed at the
same time when that particular Event triggers, resulting in
indeterminacy.)  However, I<separate> Event instances can refer to the
same variable.

=item

A variable cannot be assigned a value in an EventAssignment object
instance and also be assigned a value by an AssignmentRule; i.e., the
value of an EventAssignment's "variable" attribute cannot be the same as
the value of a AssignmentRule' "variable" attribute.  (Assignment rules
hold at all times, therefore it would be inconsistent to also define an
event that reassigns the value of the same variable.)

=back


Note that the time of assignment of the object identified by the
value of the "variable" attribute is always the time at which the Event
is <em>executed</em>, not when it is <em>fired</em>.  The timing is
controlled by the optional Delay in an Event.  The time of
assignment is not affected by the "useValuesFromTriggerTime"
attribute on Event&mdash;that attribute affects the time at which the
EventAssignment's "math" expression is I<evaluated>.  In other
words, SBML allows decoupling the time at which the
"variable" is assigned from the time at which its value
expression is calculated.
@section event-math The "math" subelement in an EventAssignment
The MathML expression contained in an EventAssignment defines the new
value of the variable being assigned by the Event.  The order of the
EventAssignment structures is not significant; the effect of one
assignment cannot affect the result of another assignment.
The time at which this expression is evaluated is determined by Event's
"useValuesFromTriggerTime" attribute.  If the attribute value is C<true>
(the default), the expression must be evaluated when the event is
<em>fired</em>; more precisely, the values of identifiers occurring in
MathML C<ci> attributes in the EventAssignment's "math" expression are
the values they have at the point when the event <em>fired</em>.  If,
instead, "useValuesFromTriggerTime"'s value is C<false>, it means the
values at <em>execution</em> time should be used; that is, the values of
identifiers occurring in MathML C<ci> attributes in the
EventAssignment's "math" expression are the values they have at the
point when the event <em>executed</em>.
Between Version&nbsp;4 and previous versions of SBML Level&nbsp;2, the
requirements regarding the matching of units between an
EvengAssignment's formula and the units of the object identified by the
"variable" attribute changed.  Previous versions required consistency,
but in Version&nbsp;4, unit consistency is only recommended.  More
precisely: 
=over
 
=item

In the case of a species, an EventAssignment sets
the referenced species' quantity (concentration or amount of substance)
to the value determined by the formula in the EventAssignment's "math"
subelement.  The units of the "math" formula should (in SBML
Level&nbsp;2 Version&nbsp;4) or must (in previous Versions) be identical
to the units of the species.

=item

In the case of a compartment, an EventAssignment sets the
referenced compartment's size to the size determined by the formula in
the "math" subelement of the EventAssignment.  The overall units of the
formula should (in SBML Level&nbsp;2 Version&nbsp;4) or must (in
previous Versions) be identical to the units specified for the size of
the compartment identified by the EventAssignment's "variable"
attribute.


=item

In the case of a parameter, an EventAssignment sets the referenced
parameter's value to that determined by the formula in "math".  The
overall units of the formula should (in SBML Level&nbsp;2
Version&nbsp;4) or must (in previous Versions) be identical to the units
defined for the parameter.

=back


Note that the formula placed in the "math" element <em>has no assumed
units</em>.  The consistency of the units of the formula, and the units
of the entity which the assignment affects, must be explicitly
established just as in the case of the value of the Delay subelement.
An approach similar to the one discussed in the context of Delay may be
used for the formula of an EventAssignment.

Readers are urged to consult the SBML specification for important
information about the interpretation of Event and EventAssignment.

=head2 ListOfEventAssignments

LibSBML implementation of SBML's ListOfEventAssignments construct.
The various ListOf___ classes in SBML are merely containers used for
organizing the main components of an SBML model.  All are derived from
the abstract class SBase, and inherit the various attributes and
subelements of SBase, such as "metaid" as and "annotation".  The
ListOf___ classes do not add any attributes of their own.
ListOfEventAssignments is entirely contained within Event.

=item EventAssignment::EventAssignment

Creates a new EventAssignment using the given SBML C<level> and C<version>
values.

@param level an unsigned int, the SBML Level to assign to this EventAssignment
@param version an unsigned int, the SBML Version to assign to this
EventAssignment

@note Upon the addition of a EventAssignment object to an SBMLDocument
(e.g., using Model::addEventAssignment()), the SBML Level, SBML
Version and XML namespace of the document I<override> the
values used when creating the EventAssignment object via this
constructor.  This is necessary to ensure that an SBML document is a
consistent structure.  Nevertheless, the ability to supply the values
at the time of creation of a EventAssignment is an important aid to
producing valid SBML.  Knowledge of the intented SBML Level and
Version determine whether it is valid to assign a particular value to
an attribute, or whether it is valid to add an object to an existing
SBMLDocument.



=item EventAssignment::EventAssignment

Creates a new EventAssignment using the given SBMLNamespaces object
C<sbmlns>.
The SBMLNamespaces object encapsulates SBML Level/Version/namespaces
information.  It is used to communicate the SBML Level, Version, and
(in Level&nbsp;3) packages used in addition to SBML Level&nbsp;3 Core.
A common approach to using this class constructor is to create an
SBMLNamespaces object somewhere in a program, once, then pass it to
object constructors such as this one when needed.
@param sbmlns an SBMLNamespaces object.
@note Upon the addition of a EventAssignment object to an SBMLDocument

=item EventAssignment::getDerivedUnitDefinition

Calculates and returns a UnitDefinition that expresses the units
of measurement assumed for the "math" expression of this
EventAssignment.

The units are calculated based on the mathematical expression in the
EventAssignment and the model quantities referenced by
C<&lt;ci&gt;> elements used within that expression.  The
EventAssignment::getDerivedUnitDefinition() method returns the
calculated units.
Note that the functionality that facilitates unit analysis depends 
on the model as a whole.  Thus, in cases where the object has not 
been added to a model or the model itself is incomplete,
unit analysis is not possible and this method will return C<NULL>.
@warning Note that it is possible the "math" expression in the
EventAssignment contains literal numbers or parameters with undeclared
units.  In those cases, it is not possible to calculate the units of
the overall expression without making assumptions.  LibSBML does not
make assumptions about the units, and
EventAssignment::getDerivedUnitDefinition() only returns the units as
far as it is able to determine them.  For example, in an expression
<em>X + Y</em>, if <em>X</em> has unambiguously-defined units and
<em>Y</em> does not, it will return the units of <em>X</em>.  When
using this method, <strong>it is critical that callers also invoke the
method</strong> EventAssignment::containsUndeclaredUnits() <strong>to
determine whether this situation holds</strong>.  Callers should take
suitable action in those situations.
Returns a UnitDefinition that expresses the units of the math 
expression of this EventAssignment, or C<NULL> if one cannot be constructed.

=head2 Trigger

LibSBML implementation of SBML's Trigger construct for Event.
An Event object defines when the event can occur, the variables that
are affected by the event, and how the variables are affected.  The
Trigger construct in SBML is used to define a mathematical expression
that determines when an Event I<fires>.
A Trigger contains one subelement named "math" containing a MathML
expression.  The expression must evaluate to a value of type C<boolean>.
The exact moment at which the expression evaluates to C<true> is the
time point when the Event is I<fired>.
An event only fires when its Trigger expression makes the transition in
value from C<false> to C<true>.  The event will also fire at any future
time points when the trigger expression makes this transition; in other
words, an event can fire multiple times during a simulation if its
trigger condition makes the transition from C<false> to C<true> more
than once.
An important question is whether an event can fire prior to, or at,
initial simulation time, that is <em>t &lt; 0</em>.  The answer is no:
an event can only be triggered immediately after initial simulation time
i.e., <em>t &gt; 0</em>.

=item Trigger::Trigger

Creates a new Trigger using the given SBML C<level> and C<version>

@note Upon the addition of a Trigger object to an SBMLDocument (e.g.,
using Model::addTrigger()), the SBML Level, SBML Version and
XML namespace of the document I<override> the values used when
creating the Trigger object via this constructor.  This is necessary
to ensure that an SBML document is a consistent structure.
Nevertheless, the ability to supply the values at the time of creation
of a Trigger is an important aid to producing valid SBML.  Knowledge
of the intented SBML Level and Version determine whether it is valid
to assign a particular value to an attribute, or whether it is valid
to add an object to an existing SBMLDocument.

A common approach to using this class constructor is to create an
SBMLNamespaces object somewhere in a program, once, then pass it to
object constructors such as this one when needed.
@param sbmlns an SBMLNamespaces object.
@note Upon the addition of a Trigger object to an SBMLDocument (e.g.,

=head2 Delay

LibSBML implementation of SBML's Delay construct for Event.
An Event object defines when the event can occur, the variables that
are affected by the event, and how the variables are affected.  The
effect of the event can optionally be delayed after the occurrence of
the condition which invokes it.  An event delay is defined using an
object of class Delay.
The object class Delay is derived from SBase and adds a single
subelement called "math".  This subelement is used to hold MathML
content.  The mathematical formula represented by "math" must evaluate
to a numerical value.  It is used as the length of time between when the
event has I<fired> and when the event's assignments are actually @em
executed.  If no delay is present on a given Event, a time delay of zero
is assumed.
The expression in "math" must be evaluated at the time the rule is @em
fired.  The expression must always evaluate to a positive number
(otherwise, a nonsensical situation could arise where an event is
defined to fire before it is triggered!).
@section delay-units The units of the mathematical expression in a Delay
In SBML Level&nbsp;2 versions before Version&nbsp;4, the units of the
numerical value computed by the Delay's "math" expression were @em
required to be in units of time or the model is considered to have a
unit consistency error.  In Version&nbsp;4, this requirement is relaxed.
The Version&nbsp;4 specification only stipulates that the units of the
numerical value computed by a Delay instance's "math" expression @em
should match the model's units of time (meaning the definition of the @c
time units in the model).  Depending on which Version of SBML
Level&nbsp;2 is in use, libSBML may or may not flag unit inconsistencies
as errors or just warnings. 
Note that <em>units are not predefined or assumed</em> for the contents
of "math" in a Delay object; rather, they must be defined explicitly for
each instance of a Delay object in a model.  This is an important point
to bear in mind when literal numbers are used in delay expressions.  For
example, the following Event instance would result in a warning logged
by SBMLDocument::checkConsistency() about the fact that libSBML cannot
verify the consistency of the units of the expression.  The reason is
that the formula inside the "math" element does not have any declared
units, whereas what is expected in this context is units of time:
C<ode>
<model>
...
<listOfEvents>
<event>
...
<delay>
<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">
<cn> 1 </cn>
</math>
</delay>
...
</event>
</listOfEvents>
...
</model>
@endcode
The C<&lt;cn&gt; 1 &lt;/cn&gt;> within the mathematical formula
of the C<delay> above has <em>no units declared</em>.  To make the
expression have the needed units of time, literal numbers should be
avoided in favor of defining Parameter objects for each quantity, and
declaring units for the Parameter values.  The following fragment of
SBML illustrates this approach:
C<ode>
<model>
...
<listOfParameters>
<parameter id="transcriptionDelay" value="10" units="time"/>
</listOfParameters>
...
<listOfEvents>
<event>
...
<delay>
<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">
<ci> transcriptionDelay </ci>

=item Delay::Delay

Creates a new Delay using the given SBML C<level> and C<version>
values.

@param level an unsigned int, the SBML Level to assign to this Delay
@param version an unsigned int, the SBML Version to assign to this
Delay

@note Upon the addition of a Delay object to an SBMLDocument (e.g.,
using Model::addDelay()), the SBML Level, SBML Version and XML
namespace of the document I<override> the values used when creating
the Delay object via this constructor.  This is necessary to ensure
that an SBML document is a consistent structure.  Nevertheless, the
ability to supply the values at the time of creation of a Delay is an
important aid to producing valid SBML.  Knowledge of the intented SBML
Level and Version determine whether it is valid to assign a particular
value to an attribute, or whether it is valid to add an object to an
existing SBMLDocument.


=item Delay::Delay

Creates a new Delay using the given SBMLNamespaces object
C<sbmlns>.
The SBMLNamespaces object encapsulates SBML Level/Version/namespaces
information.  It is used to communicate the SBML Level, Version, and
(in Level&nbsp;3) packages used in addition to SBML Level&nbsp;3 Core.
A common approach to using this class constructor is to create an
SBMLNamespaces object somewhere in a program, once, then pass it to
object constructors such as this one when needed.
@param sbmlns an SBMLNamespaces object.
@note Upon the addition of a Delay object to an SBMLDocument (e.g.,
using Model::addDelay()), the SBML XML namespace of the document @em
overrides the value used when creating the Delay object via this
constructor.  This is necessary to ensure that an SBML document is a
consistent structure.  Nevertheless, the ability to supply the values
at the time of creation of a Delay is an important aid to producing
valid SBML.  Knowledge of the intented SBML Level and Version
determine whether it is valid to assign a particular value to an
attribute, or whether it is valid to add an object to an existing
SBMLDocument.

Returns the math of this Delay.


=item Delay::isSetMath

Predicate to test whether the formula for this delay has been set.

this Delay has been set, C<false> otherwise.


=item Delay::setMath

ASTNode.

@param math an ASTNode representing a formula tree.

=item Delay::getDerivedUnitDefinition

Calculates and returns a UnitDefinition that expresses the units
of measurement assumed for the "math" expression of this Delay.
Delay elements in SBML express a time delay for an Event.  Beginning
with SBML Level&nbsp;2 Version&nbsp;2, the units of that time are
calculated based on the mathematical expression and the model
quantities referenced by C<&lt;ci&gt;> elements used within
that expression.  The Delay::getDerivedUnitDefinition() method returns
what libSBML computes the units to be, to the extent that libSBML can
compute them.
(Prior to SBML Level&nbsp;2 Version&nbsp;2, there existed an attribute
on Event called "timeUnits".  This attribute could be used to set the
intended units of the delay expression.  For such models, this will
return a UnitDefinition object that corresponds to the declared
"timeUnits" units.)
Note that the functionality that facilitates unit analysis depends 
on the model as a whole.  Thus, in cases where the object has not 
been added to a model or the model itself is incomplete,
unit analysis is not possible and this method will return C<NULL>.
@warning Note that it is possible the "math" expression in the Delay
contains literal numbers or parameters with undeclared units.  In
those cases, it is not possible to calculate the units of the overall
expression without making assumptions.  LibSBML does not make
assumptions about the units, and Delay::getDerivedUnitDefinition()
only returns the units as far as it is able to determine them.  For
example, in an expression <em>X + Y</em>, if <em>X</em> has
unambiguously-defined units and <em>Y</em> does not, it will return
the units of <em>X</em>.  When using this method, <strong>it is
critical that callers also invoke the method</strong>
Delay::containsUndeclaredUnits() <strong>to determine whether this
situation holds</strong>.  Callers should take suitable action in
those situations.
Returns a UnitDefinition that expresses the units of the math 
expression of this Delay, or C<NULL> if one cannot be constructed.
@see containsUndeclaredUnits()


=item Delay::getDerivedUnitDefinition

Calculates and returns a UnitDefinition that expresses the units
of measurement assumed for the "math" expression of this Delay.
Delay elements in SBML express a time delay for an Event.  Beginning

=item Delay::containsUndeclaredUnits

Predicate returning C<true> if 
the "math" expression in this Delay instance contains
parameters with undeclared units or literal numbers.
Delay elements in SBML express a time delay for an Event.  Beginning
with SBML Level&nbsp;2 Version&nbsp;2, the units of that time are
calculated based on the mathematical expression and the model
quantities referenced by C<&lt;ci&gt;> elements used within
that expression.  The Delay::getDerivedUnitDefinition() method returns
what libSBML computes the units to be, to the extent that libSBML can
compute them.  However, if the expression contains literal numbers or
parameters with undeclared units, libSBML may not be able to compute
the full units of the expression and will only return what it can
compute.  Callers should always use Delay::containsUndeclaredUnits()
when using Delay::getDerivedUnitDefinition() to decide whether the
returned units may be incomplete.
Returns C<true> if the math expression of this Delay includes
numbers/parameters with undeclared units, C<false> otherwise.

=item SyntaxChecker::isValidSBMLSId

Returns true C<true> or C<false> depending on whether the argument
string conforms to the syntax of SBML identifiers.
In SBML, identifiers that are the values of C<id> attributes
on objects must conform to a data type called C<SId> in the
SBML specifications.  LibSBML does not provide an explicit
C<SId> data type; instead, it tests for identifier validity
at various times, such as when reading in models from files and data
streams.  To enable calling programs to test that the identifiers they
generate also conform to the SBML identifier syntax, libSBML provides
this method.

In SBML, the identifiers of units (of both the predefined units and
user-defined units) must conform to a data type called
C<UnitSId> in the SBML specifications.  LibSBML does not
provide an explicit C<UnitSId> data type; instead, it tests
for identifier validity at various times, such as when reading in
models from files and data streams.  To enable calling programs to

=item SyntaxChecker::hasExpectedXHTMLSyntax

Returns C<true> or C<false> depending on whether the given XMLNode
object contains valid XHTML content.
In SBML, the content of the "notes" subelement available on SBase, as
well as the "message" subelement available on Constraint, must conform
to <a target="_blank"
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/">XHTML&nbsp;1.0</a> (which is
simply an XML-ized version of HTML).  However, the content cannot be
I<entirely> free-form; it must satisfy certain requirements defined in
the <a target="_blank"
href="http://sbml.org/Documents/Specifications">SBML
specifications</a> for specific SBML Levels.  This method implements a
verification process that lets callers check whether the content of a
given XMLNode object conforms to the SBML requirements for "notes" and
"message" structure.
An aspect of XHTML validity is that the content is declared to be in
the XML namespace for XHTML&nbsp;1.0.  There is more than one way in
which this can be done in XML.  In particular, a model might not
contain the declaration within the "notes" or "message" subelement
itself, but might instead place the declaration on an enclosing
element and use an XML namespace prefix within the "notes" element to
refer to it.  In other words, the following is valid:
@verbatim
<sbml xmlns="http://www.sbml.org/sbml/level2/version3" level="2" version="3"
xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">

<xhtml:p>A minimal cascade model for the mitotic oscillator.</xhtml:p>
</xhtml:body>
</notes>
... rest of model ...
</sbml>
@endverbatim
Contrast the above with the following, self-contained version, which
places the XML namespace declaration within the C<&lt;notes&gt;>
element itself:

=head2 StoichiometryMath

LibSBML implementation of SBML Level&nbsp;2's StoichiometryMath construct.
@section l2-stoichiometries Stoichiometries in SBML Level 2
In SBML Level 2, product and reactant stoichiometries can be specified
using I<either> the "stoichiometry" attribute or a "stoichiometryMath"
element in a SpeciesReference object.  The "stoichiometry" attribute is
of type C<double> and should contain values greater than zero (0).  The
"stoichiometryMath" element is implemented as an element containing a
MathML expression.  These two are mutually exclusive; only one of
"stoichiometry" or "stoichiometryMath" should be defined in a given
SpeciesReference instance.  When neither the attribute nor the element
is present, the value of "stoichiometry" in the enclosing
SpeciesReference instance defaults to C<1>.
For maximum interoperability, SpeciesReference's "stoichiometry"
attribute should be used in preference to "stoichiometryMath" when a
species' stoichiometry is a simple scalar number (integer or decimal).
When the stoichiometry is a rational number, or when it is a more
complicated formula, "stoichiometryMath" must be used.  The MathML
expression in "stoichiometryMath" may also refer to identifiers of
entities in a model (except reaction identifiers).  However, the only
species identifiers that can be used in "stoichiometryMath" are those
referenced in the enclosing Reaction's list of reactants, products and
modifiers.

The "stoichiometry" attribute and the "stoichiometryMath" element, when
either is used, is each interpreted as a factor applied to the reaction
rate to produce the rate of change of the species identified by the
"species" attribute in the enclosing SpeciesReference.  This is the
normal interpretation of a stoichiometry, but in SBML, one additional
consideration has to be taken into account.  The reaction rate, which is
the result of the KineticLaw's "math" element, is always in the model's
I<substance> per I<time> units.  However, the rate of change of the
species will involve the species' I<substance> units (i.e., the units
identified by the Species object's "substanceUnits" attribute), and
these units may be different from the model's default I<substance>
units.  If the units I<are> different, the stoichiometry must
incorporate a conversion factor for converting the model's I<substance>
units to the species' I<substance> units.  The conversion factor is
assumed to be included in the scalar value of the "stoichiometry"
attribute if "stoichiometry" is used.  If instead "stoichiometryMath" is
used, then the product of the model's "substance" units times the
"stoichiometryMath" units must match the I<substance> units of the
species.  Note that in either case, if the species' units and the
model's default I<substance> units are the same, the stoichiometry ends
up being a dimensionless number and equivalent to the standard chemical
stoichiometry found in textbooks.  Examples and more explanations of
this are given in the SBML specification.
The following is a simple example of a species reference for species @c
"X0", with stoichiometry C<2>, in a list of reactants within a reaction
having the identifier C<"J1">:
C<ode>
<model>
...
<listOfReactions>
<reaction id="J1">
<listOfReactants>
<speciesReference species="X0" stoichiometry="2">
</listOfReactants>
...
</reaction>
...
</listOfReactions>
...
</model>
@endcode
The following is a more complex example of a species reference for
species C<"X0">, with a stoichiometry formula consisting of
a rational number:
C<ode>
<model>
...
<listOfReactions>
<reaction id="J1">
<listOfReactants>
<speciesReference species="X0">
<stoichiometryMath>
<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"> 
<cn type="rational"> 3 <sep/> 2 </cn>
</math>
</stoichiometryMath>
</speciesReference>
</listOfReactants>
...
</reaction>
...
</listOfReactions>
...
</model>
@endcode

Additional discussions of stoichiometries and implications for species
and reactions are included in the documentation of SpeciesReference
class.

@section l3-stoichiometries Stoichiometries in SBML Level 3
The StoichiometryMath construct is not defined in SBML Level&nbsp;3
Version&nbsp;1 Core.  Instead, Level&nbsp;3 defines the identifier of
SpeciesReference objects as a stand-in for the stoichiometry of the
reactant or product being referenced, and allows that identifier to be
used elsewhere in SBML models, including (for example) InitialAssignment
objects.  This makes it possible to achieve the same effect as
StoichiometryMath, but with other SBML objects.  For instance, to
produce a stoichiometry value that is a rational number, a model can use
InitialAssignment to assign the identifier of a SpeciesReference object
to a MathML expression evaluating to a rational number.  This is
analogous to the same way that, in Level&nbsp;2, the model would use
StoichiometryMath with a MathML expression evaluating to a rational
number.

In SBML Level 2, the stoichiometry of a reactant or product is a
combination of both a <em>biochemical stoichiometry</em> (meaning, the
standard stoichiometry of a species in a reaction) and any necessary
unit conversion factors. The introduction of an explicit attribute on
the Species object for a conversion factor allows Level&nbsp;3 to avoid
having to overload the meaning of stoichiometry.  In Level&nbsp;3, the
stoichiometry given by a SpeciesReference object in a reaction is a
"proper" biochemical stoichiometry, meaning a dimensionless number free
of unit conversions.

StoichiometryMath

@note Upon the addition of a StoichiometryMath object to an
SBMLDocument (e.g., using Model::addStoichiometryMath()), the SBML
Level, SBML Version and XML namespace of the document @em
override the values used when creating the StoichiometryMath object
via this constructor.  This is necessary to ensure that an SBML
document is a consistent structure.  Nevertheless, the ability to
supply the values at the time of creation of a StoichiometryMath is an
important aid to producing valid SBML.  Knowledge of the intented SBML
Level and Version determine whether it is valid to assign a particular
value to an attribute, or whether it is valid to add an object to an

(in Level&nbsp;3) packages used in addition to SBML Level&nbsp;3 Core.
A common approach to using this class constructor is to create an
SBMLNamespaces object somewhere in a program, once, then pass it to
object constructors such as this one when needed.
@param sbmlns an SBMLNamespaces object.

=item StoichiometryMath::getDerivedUnitDefinition

Calculates and returns a UnitDefinition object that expresses the
units returned by the math expression in this StoichiometryMath
object.

The units are calculated based on the mathematical expression in the
StoichiometryMath and the model quantities referenced by
C<&lt;ci&gt;> elements used within that expression.  The
StoichiometryMath::getDerivedUnitDefinition() method returns the
calculated units.
Note that the functionality that facilitates unit analysis depends 
on the model as a whole.  Thus, in cases where the object has not 
been added to a model or the model itself is incomplete,
unit analysis is not possible and this method will return C<NULL>.
@warning Note that it is possible the "math" expression in the
StoichiometryMath instance contains literal numbers or parameters with
undeclared units.  In those cases, it is not possible to calculate the
units of the overall expression without making assumptions.  LibSBML
does not make assumptions about the units, and
StoichiometryMath::getDerivedUnitDefinition() only returns the units
as far as it is able to determine them.  For example, in an expression
<em>X + Y</em>, if <em>X</em> has unambiguously-defined units and
<em>Y</em> does not, it will return the units of <em>X</em>.  When
using this method, <strong>it is critical that callers also invoke the
method</strong> StoichiometryMath::containsUndeclaredUnits()

=head2 SBMLNamespaces

Class to store SBML level, version and namespace information.
@htmlinclude not-sbml-warning.html
There are differences in the definitions of components between different
SBML Levels, as well as Versions within Levels.  For example, the
"sboTerm" attribute was not introduced until Level&nbsp;2
Version&nbsp;2, and then only on certain component classes; the SBML
Level&nbsp;2 Version&nbsp;3 specification moved the "sboTerm" attribute
to the SBase class, thereby allowing nearly all components to have SBO
annotations.  As a result of differences such as those, libSBML needs to
track the SBML Level and Version of every object created.
The purpose of the SBMLNamespaces object class is to make it easier to
communicate SBML Level and Version data between libSBML constructors and
other methods.  The SBMLNamespaces object class tracks 3-tuples
(triples) consisting of SBML Level, Version, and the corresponding SBML
XML namespace.  (The plural name is not a mistake, because in SBML
Level&nbsp;3, objects may have extensions added by Level&nbsp;3 packages
used by a given model; however, until the introduction of SBML
Level&nbsp;3, the SBMLNamespaces object only records one SBML
Level/Version/namespace combination at a time.)  Most constructors for
SBML objects in libSBML take a SBMLNamespaces object as an argument,
thereby allowing the constructor to produce the proper combination of
attributes and other internal data structures for the given SBML
Level and Version.

=head2 ASTNode

Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) representation of a
mathematical expression.
@htmlinclude not-sbml-warning.html
Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) are a simple kind of data structure used in
libSBML for storing mathematical expressions.  The ASTNode is the
cornerstone of libSBML's AST representation.  ASTNodes represent the
most basic, indivisible part of a mathematical formula and come in many
types.  For instance, there are node types to represent numbers (with
subtypes to distinguish integer, real, and rational numbers), names
(e.g., constants or variables), simple mathematical operators, logical
or relational operators and functions. LibSBML ASTs provide a canonical,
in-memory representation for all mathematical formulas regardless of
their original format (which might be MathML or might be text strings).
An AST I<node> in libSBML is a recursive structure containing a pointer
to the node's value (which might be, for example, a number or a symbol)
and a list of children nodes.  Each ASTNode node may have none, one,
two, or more child depending on its type. The following diagram
illustrates an example of how the mathematical expression C<"1 +
2"> is represented as an AST with one I<plus> node having two @em
integer children nodes for the numbers C<1> and
C<2>.  The figure also shows the corresponding MathML
representation:

@image html astnode-illustration.jpg "Example AST representation of a mathematical expression."
@image latex astnode-illustration.jpg "Example AST representation of a mathematical expression."
The following are other noteworthy points about the AST representation
in libSBML:

=over


=item

A numerical value represented in MathML as a real number with an
exponent is preserved as such in the AST node representation, even if
the number could be stored in a C<double> data type.  This is done
so that when an SBML model is read in and then written out again, the
amount of change introduced by libSBML to the SBML during the round-trip
activity is minimized.

=item

Rational numbers are represented in an AST node using separate
numerator and denominator values.  These can be retrieved using the
methods ASTNode::getNumerator() and ASTNode::getDenominator().

=item

The children of an ASTNode are other ASTNode objects.  The list of
children is empty for nodes that are leaf elements, such as numbers.
For nodes that are actually roots of expression subtrees, the list of
children points to the parsed objects that make up the rest of the
expression.

node's type will be C<AST_PLUS>, C<AST_MINUS>, C<AST_TIMES>, C<AST_DIVIDE>,
or C<AST_POWER>, as appropriate.

=item

If the node is a predefined function or operator from SBML Level 1
(in the string-based formula syntax used in Level 1) or SBML Level 2
(in the subset of MathML used in SBML Level 2), then the node's type
will be either C<AST_FUNCTION_><em><span
class="placeholder">X</span></em>, C<AST_LOGICAL_><em><span
class="placeholder">X</span></em>, or
C<AST_RELATIONAL_><em><span class="placeholder">X</span></em>,
as appropriate.  (Examples: C<AST_FUNCTION_LOG>, C<AST_RELATIONAL_LEQ>.)

=item

If the node refers to a user-defined function, the node's type will
be C<AST_NAME> (because it holds the name of the function).

=item

If the node is a lambda expression, its type will be C<AST_LAMBDA>.

=item

If the node is a predefined constant (C<"ExponentialE">, C<"Pi">, 
C<"True"> or C<"False">), then the node's type will be C<AST_CONSTANT_E>,
C<AST_CONSTANT_PI>, C<AST_CONSTANT_TRUE>, or C<AST_CONSTANT_FALSE>.

=item

(Level 2 only) If the node is the special MathML csymbol C<time>,
the value of the node will be C<AST_NAME_TIME>.  (Note, however, that the
MathML csymbol C<delay> is translated into a node of type
C<AST_FUNCTION_DELAY>.  The difference is due to the fact that C<time> is a
single variable, whereas C<delay> is actually a function taking
arguments.)

If the node contains a numerical value, its type will be
C<AST_INTEGER>, C<AST_REAL>, C<AST_REAL_E>, or C<AST_RATIONAL>,
as appropriate.

The formula strings may contain operators, function calls, symbols, and

expressed in the syntax:
@verbatim
0.10   k4^2
@endverbatim
@verbatim
(vm   s1)/(km + s1)
@endverbatim
The following table shows the precedence rules in this syntax.  In the
Class column, I<operand> implies the construct is an operand, @em
prefix implies the operation is applied to the following arguments, @em
unary implies there is one argument, and I<binary> implies there are
two arguments.  The values in the Precedence column show how the order
of different types of operation are determined.  For example, the
expression <em>a   b + c</em> is evaluated as <em>(a   b) + c</em>
because the C< > operator has higher precedence.  The
Associates column shows how the order of similar precedence operations
is determined; for example, <em>a - b + c</em> is evaluated as <em>(a -
b) + c</em> because the C<+> and C<-> operators are
left-associative.  The precedence and associativity rules are taken from
the C programming language, except for the symbol C<^>, which
is used in C for a different purpose.  (Exponentiation can be invoked
using either C<^> or the function C<power>.)
@htmlinclude math-precedence-table.html 
A program parsing a formula in an SBML model should assume that names
appearing in the formula are the identifiers of Species, Parameter,
Compartment, FunctionDefinition, or Reaction objects defined in a model.
When a function call is involved, the syntax consists of a function
identifier, followed by optional white space, followed by an opening
parenthesis, followed by a sequence of zero or more arguments separated
by commas (with each comma optionally preceded and/or followed by zero
or more white space characters), followed by a closing parenthesis.
There is an almost one-to-one mapping between the list of predefined
functions available, and those defined in MathML.  All of the MathML
functions are recognized; this set is larger than the functions defined
in SBML Level&nbsp;1.  In the subset of functions that overlap between
MathML and SBML Level&nbsp;1, there exist a few differences.  The

C<AST_LOGICAL_><em><span class="placeholder">X</span></em> type.

SBML Level&nbsp;1 function names are searched first; thus, for
example, canonicalizing C<log> will result in a node type of @link
ASTNodeType_t#AST_FUNCTION_LN AST_FUNCTION_LN@endlink.  (See the SBML
Level&nbsp;1 Version&nbsp;2 Specification, Appendix C.)
Sometimes, canonicalization of a node results in a structural
conversion of the node as a result of adding a child.  For example, a
node with the SBML Level&nbsp;1 function name C<sqr> and a single
child node (the argument) will be transformed to a node of type
@link ASTNodeType_t#AST_FUNCTION_POWER AST_FUNCTION_POWER@endlink with
two children.  The first child will remain unchanged, but the second
child will be an ASTNode of type @link ASTNodeType_t#AST_INTEGER
AST_INTEGER@endlink and a value of 2.  The function names that result

=head2 XMLNamespaces

Representation of XML Namespaces.
@htmlinclude not-sbml-warning.html
This class serves to organize functionality for tracking XML namespaces
in a document or data stream.  The namespace declarations are stored as
a list of pairs of XML namespace URIs and prefix strings.  These
correspond to the parts of a namespace declaration on an XML element.
For example, in the following XML fragment,
@verbatim
<annotation>
<mysim:nodecolors xmlns:mysim="urn:lsid:mysim.org"
mysim:bgcolor="green" mysim:fgcolor="white"/>
</annotation>
@endverbatim
there is one namespace declaration.  Its URI is
C<urn:lsid:mysim.org> and its prefix is C<mysim>.
This pair could be stored as one item in an XMLNamespaces list.
XMLNamespaces provides various methods for manipulating the list of
prefix-URI pairs.  Individual namespaces stored in a given XMLNamespace
object instance can be retrieved based on their index using
XMLNamespaces::getPrefix(int index), or by their characteristics such as
their URI or position in the list.

declarations.

An XMLNamespace object stores a list of pairs of namespaces and their
prefixes.  If there is an XML namespace with the given C<uri> prefix
in this list, then its corresponding URI will be overwritten by the
new C<uri>.  Calling programs could use one of the other XMLNamespaces
methods, such as
@if clike XMLNamespaces::hasPrefix() @endif@if java XMLNamespaces::hasPrefix(String) @endif and 
@if clike XMLNamespaces::hasURI() @endif@if java XMLNamespaces::hasURI(String) @endif to

=head2 XMLNode

Representation of a node in an XML document tree.
Beginning with version 3.0.0, libSBML implements an XML abstraction
layer.  This layer presents a uniform XML interface to calling programs
regardless of which underlying XML parser libSBML has actually been
configured to use.  The basic data object in the XML abstraction is a
I<node>, represented by XMLNode.
An XMLNode can contain any number of children.  Each child is another
XMLNode, thereby forming a tree.  The methods XMLNode::getNumChildren()
and @if clike XMLNode::getChild() can be used to access the
tree structure starting from a given node. @endif@if java XMLNode::getChild(long n)
can be used to access the tree structure starting from a given node.
@endif

Each XMLNode is subclassed from XMLToken, and thus has the same methods
available as XMLToken.  These methods include XMLToken::getNamespaces(),
XMLToken::getPrefix(), XMLToken::getName(), XMLToken::getURI(), and
XMLToken::getAttributes().

@section xmlnode-str2xmlnode Conversion between an XML string and an XMLNode
LibSBML provides the following utility functions for converting an XML string 
(e.g., &lt;annotation&gt;...&lt;/annotation&gt;) to/from an XMLNode object.

=over


=item

XMLNode::toXMLString() returns a string representation of the XMLNode object. 

=item

XMLNode::convertXMLNodeToString() (static function) returns a string representation 
of the given XMLNode object.

=item

XMLNode::convertStringToXMLNode() (static function) returns an XMLNode object converted 
from the given XML string.

=back


The returned XMLNode object by XMLNode::convertStringToXMLNode() is a dummy root 
(container) XMLNode if the given XML string has two or more top-level elements 
(e.g., "&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;"). In the dummy root node, each top-level element in 
the given XML string is contained as a child XMLNode. XMLToken::isEOF() can be used 
to identify if the returned XMLNode object is a dummy node or not. 
Here is an example:
@if clike @verbatim
// Checks if the returned XMLNode object by XMLNode::convertStringToXMLNode() is a dummy root node:
std::string str = "..."; 
XMLNode  xn = XMLNode::convertStringToXMLNode(str);                                      
if (!xn)
{

=head2 XMLTriple

Representation of a qualified XML name.
@htmlinclude not-sbml-warning.html
A "triple" in the libSBML XML layer encapsulates the notion of qualified
name, meaning an element name or an attribute name with an optional
namespace qualifier.  An XMLTriple instance carries up to three data items:

=over



=item

The name of the attribute or element; that is, the attribute name
as it appears in an XML document or data stream;

=item

The XML namespace prefix (if any) of the attribute.  For example,
in the following fragment of XML, the namespace prefix is the string
C<mysim> and it appears on both the element
C<someelement> and the attribute C<attribA>.  When
both the element and the attribute are stored as XMLTriple objects,
their <i>prefix</i> is C<mysim>.
@verbatim
<mysim:someelement mysim:attribA="value" />
@endverbatim

=item

The XML namespace URI with which the prefix is associated.  In
XML, every namespace used must be declared and mapped to a URI.

XMLTriple objects are the lowest-level data item in the XML layer
of libSBML.  Other objects such as XMLToken make use of XMLTriple
objects.

=head2 XMLError

Representation of errors, warnings and other diagnostics
@htmlinclude not-sbml-warning.html
LibSBML can be configured to use any of a number of XML parsers; at the
time of this writing, libSBML supports Xerces versions 2.4 through 3.0,
Expat version 1.95.x and higher, and libxml2 version 2.6.16 and higher.
These parsers each report different status codes for the various
exceptions that can occur during XML processing.  The XMLError object
class abstracts away from the particular diagnostics reported by the
different parsers and presents a single uniform interface and set of
status codes, along with operations for manipulating the error objects.
When the libSBML XML parser layer encounters an error in the XML content
being processed, or when there is something else wrong (such as an
out-of-memory condition), the problems are reported as XMLError objects.
Each XMLError object instance has an identification number that
identifies the nature of the problem.
@if clike This error identifier will be up to five digits 
long and drawn from the enumeration <a class="el"
href="#XMLErrorCode_t">XMLErrorCode_t</a>.  Applications can use the
error identifiers as a means of recognizing the error encountered and
changing their behavior if desired. @endif@if java This
error identifier is one of the constants listed in the next section below.
Applications can use the error identifiers as a means of recognizing the
error encountered and changing their behavior if desired.  @endif
Integer error codes are useful for software, but not so much for telling
humans what happened.  For this reason, XMLError also provides two text
messages describing the nature of the error.  These messages are
accessible by means of the methods XMLError::getShortMessage() and
XMLError::getMessage().  The method XMLError::getShortMessage() returns
a very brief synopsis of the warning or error condition, whereas
XMLError::getMessage() returns a longer explanation.  These text strings
are suitable for displaying to human users.
Each XMLError object also contains a category code; its value may be
retrieved using the method XMLError::getCategory().  Category values
are @if clike drawn from the enumeration
<a class="el" href="#XMLErrorCategory_t">XMLErrorCategory_t</a> 
described below.  Categories are used by libSBML to provide more
information to calling programs about the nature of a given
error. @endif@if java drawn from a set of constants whose
names begin with the characters C<LIBSBML_CAT_>.  The list of possible
codes is described in a separate section below. Categories are used by
libSBML to provide more information to calling programs about the nature
of a given error.  @endif
In addition to category codes, each XMLError object also has a severity
code; its value may be retrieved using the method
XMLError::getSeverity().  Severity code values are 
@if clike drawn from the enumeration 
<a class="el" href="#XMLErrorSeverity_t">XMLErrorSeverity_t</a> described
in a separate section below.  Severity levels range from informational
(C<LIBSBML_SEV_INFO>) to fatal errors (C<LIBSBML_SEV_FATAL>).
@endif@if java drawn from a
set of constants whose names begin with the characters C<LIBSBML_SEV_>.
The list of possible severity codes is described in a separate section
below.  Severity levels range from informational (C<LIBSBML_SEV_INFO>)
to fatal errors (C<LIBSBML_SEV_FATAL>). @endif
Finally, XMLError objects record the line and column near where the
problem occurred in the XML content.  The values can be retrieved using
the methods XMLError::getLine() and XMLError::getColumn().  We say "near
where the problem occurred", because many factors affect how accurate
the line/column information ultimately is.  For example, different XML
parsers have different conventions for which line and column number they
report for a particular problem (which in turn makes a difference when a
problem involves an opening XML tag on one line and a closing tag on
another line).  In some situations, some parsers report invalid line
and/or column numbers altogether.  If this occurs, libSBML sets the line
and/or column number in the XMLError object to the the value of the
maximum unsigned long integer representable on the platform where
libSBML is running.  (This is equal to the constant named

or column number in an SBML model would equal this value is vanishingly
small; thus, if an application encounters these values in an XMLError
object, it can assume no valid line/column number could be provided by
libSBML in that situation.

=item XMLError::XMLError

Creates a new XMLError to report that something occurred during XML
processing.

XMLError objects have identification numbers to indicate the nature of
the exception.  @if clike These numbers are drawn from
the enumeration <a class="el"
href="#XMLErrorCode_t">XMLErrorCode_t</a>.
@endif@if java These numbers are defined as unsigned 
integer constants in the file
"libsbmlConstants.java".  See the <a class="el"
href="#XMLErrorCode_t">top of this documentation</a> for a table
listing the possible values and their meanings. @endif The argument @p
errorId to this constructor I<can> be (but does not have to be) a
value from this @if clike enumeration. If it is a value
from <a class="el" href="#XMLErrorCode_t">XMLErrorCode_t</a>, the
XMLError class assumes the error is a low-level system or XML layer
error and <em>prepends</em> a built-in, predefined error message to
any string passed in the argument C<details> to this constructor.  In
addition, all <a class="el" href="#XMLErrorCode_t">XMLErrorCode_t</a>
errors have associated values for the C<severity> and C<category>
codes, and these fields are filled-in as well from the enumerations <a
class="el" href="#XMLErrorSeverity_t">XMLErrorSeverity_t</a> and <a
class="el" href="#XMLErrorCategory_t">XMLErrorCategory_t</a>,
respectively. @endif@if java set of constants.  If it is
one of the predefined error identifiers, the XMLError class assumes
the error is a low-level system or XML layer error and
<em>prepends</em> a built-in, predefined error message to any string
passed in the argument C<details> to this constructor.  In addition,
all the predefined error identifiers have associated values for the @p
severity and C<category> codes, and these fields are filled-in as
well. @endif
If the error identifier C<errorId> is a number greater than 9999, this
constructor assumes that the error was generated from another part of
the software, and does not do additional filling in of values beyond
the defaults in the constructor itself.  This allows XMLError to serve
as a base class for other errors (and is used in this way elsewhere in
libSBML).  Callers should fill in all the parameters with suitable
values if generating errors with codes greater than 9999 to make
maximum use of the XMLError facilities.
@if clike As mentioned above, there are two other
enumerations, <a class="el"
href="#XMLErrorSeverity_t">XMLErrorSeverity_t</a> and <a class="el"
href="#XMLErrorCategory_t">XMLErrorCategory_t</a>, used for indicating
the severity and category of error for the predefined XMLError codes.

assigned based on the error code.  If the value of C<errorId> is a
value from <a class="el" href="#XMLErrorCode_t">XMLErrorCode_t</a>,
callers do not need to fill in C<severity> and C<category>.
Conversely, if C<errorId> is not a value from <a class="el"
href="#XMLErrorCode_t">XMLErrorCode_t</a>, callers can use other
values (not just those from <a class="el"
href="#XMLErrorSeverity_t">XMLErrorSeverity_t</a> and <a class="el"
href="#XMLErrorCategory_t">XMLErrorCategory_t</a>, but their own
special values) for C<severity> and @p

there are additional constants defined for <a class="el"
href="#XMLErrorSeverity_t">standard severity</a> and <a class="el"
href="#XMLErrorCategory_t">standard category</a> codes, and every predefined 
error in libSBML has an associated value for severity and category taken
from these predefined sets.  These constants have symbol names
prefixed with C<LIBSBML_SEV_> and C<LIBSBML_CAT_>,
respectively.  If the value of C<errorId> is one of the standard error
codes, callers do not need to fill in C<severity> and C<category> in a
call to this constructor.  Conversely, if C<errorId> is not an existing
XML-level error code, callers can use other values for C<severity> and
C<category>. @endif

@param details a string containing additional details about the error.

=item XMLError::getLine

Returns the line number in the XML input near where the error, warning

We say "near where the problem occurred", because many factors affect
how accurate the line/column information ultimately is.  For example,
different XML parsers have different conventions for which line and
column number they report for a particular problem (which in turn
makes a difference when a problem involves an opening XML tag on one
line and a closing tag on another line).  In some situations, some
parsers report invalid line and/or column numbers altogether.  If this
occurs, the line and/or column number in the XMLError object will be
set to the the value of the maximum unsigned long integer
representable on the platform where libSBML is running.  (This is
equal to the constant named C<ULONG_MAX> in C and C++.)  The
probability that a true line or column number in an SBML model would
equal this value is vanishingly small; thus, if an application
encounters these values in an XMLError object, it can assume no valid
line/column number could be provided by libSBML in that situation.

=head2 XMLErrorLog

Log of errors and other events encountered while processing an XML
file or data stream.
@htmlinclude not-sbml-warning.html
The error log is a list.  The XML layer of libSBML maintains an error
log associated with a given XML document or data stream.  When an
operation results in an error, or when there is something wrong with the
XML content, the problem is reported as an XMLError object stored in the
XMLErrorLog list.  Potential problems range from low-level issues (such
as the inability to open a file) to XML syntax errors (such as
mismatched tags or other problems).
A typical approach for using this error log is to first use
getNumErrors() to inquire how many XMLError object instances it
contains, and then to iterate over the list of objects one at a time
using getError(unsigned int n) const.  Indexing in the list begins at 0.
In normal circumstances, programs using libSBML will actually obtain an
SBMLErrorLog rather than an XMLErrorLog.  The former is subclassed from
XMLErrorLog and simply wraps commands for working with SBMLError objects
rather than the low-level XMLError objects.  Classes such as
SBMLDocument use the higher-level SBMLErrorLog.

To retrieve individual errors from the log, callers may use
getError(unsigned int n) const.
Returns the number of errors that have been logged.


=item XMLErrorLog::getError

Returns the <i>n</i>th XMLError object in this log.
Index C<n> is counted from 0.  Callers should first inquire about the
number of items in the log by using the method getNumErrors().
Attempts to use an error index number that exceeds the actual number
of errors in the log will result in a C<NULL> being returned.
@param n the index number of the error to retrieve (with 0 being the

=head2 SBMLErrorLog

Log of errors and other events encountered during SBML processing.
@htmlinclude not-sbml-warning.html
The error log is a list.  Each SBMLDocument maintains its own
SBMLErrorLog.  When a libSBML operation on SBML content results in an
error, or when there is something worth noting about the SBML content,
the issue is reported as an SBMLError object stored in the SBMLErrorLog
list.

SBMLErrorLog is derived from XMLErrorLog, an object class that serves
exactly the same purpose but for the XML parsing layer.  XMLErrorLog
provides crucial methods such as getNumErrors() for determining how many
SBMLError or XMLError objects are in the log.  SBMLErrorLog inherits
these methods.
The general approach to working with SBMLErrorLog in user programs
involves first obtaining a pointer to a log from a libSBML object such
as SBMLDocument.  Callers should then use getNumErrors() to inquire how
many objects there are in the list.  (The answer may be 0.)  If there is
at least one SBMLError object in the SBMLErrorLog instance, callers can
then iterate over the list using getError(unsigned int n) const, using
methods provided by the SBMLError class to find out the error code and
associated information such as the error severity, the message, and the
line number in the input.
If you wish to simply print the error strings for a human to read, an
easier and more direct way might be to use SBMLDocument::printErrors().

=item SBMLErrorLog::getError

Returns the <i>n</i>th SBMLError object in this log.
Index C<n> is counted from 0.  Callers should first inquire about the
number of items in the log by using the getNumErrors() method.  (This
method is inherited from the parent class, XMLErrorLog).  Attempts to
use an error index number that exceeds the actual number of errors in
the log will result in a C<NULL> being returned.
@param n the index number of the error to retrieve (with 0 being the
first error).
Returns the <i>n</i>th SBMLError in this log, or C<NULL> if C<n> is
greater than or equal to getNumErrors().
@see getNumErrors()


=item SBMLErrorLog::getNumFailsWithSeverity

Returns the number of errors that have been logged with the given
severity code.
LibSBML associates severity levels with every SBMLError object to
provide an indication of how serious the problem is.  Severities range
from informational diagnostics to fatal (irrecoverable) errors.  Given
an SBMLError object instance, a caller can interrogate it for its
severity level using methods such as SBMLError::getSeverity(),
SBMLError::isFatal(), and so on.  The present method encapsulates
iteration and interrogation of all objects in an SBMLErrorLog, making
it easy to check for the presence of error objects with specific
severity levels.
@if clike @param severity a value from
#SBMLErrorSeverity_t @endif@if java @param severity a
value from the set of C<LIBSBML_SEV_> constants defined by

=head2 SBMLError

Representation of errors, warnings and other diagnostics
@htmlinclude not-sbml-warning.html
When a libSBML operation on SBML content results in an error, or when
there is something wrong with the SBML content, the problems are
reported as SBMLError objects.  These are generally stored in an
SBMLErrorLog object; this log object, in turn, is kept in the
SBMLDocument object containing the SBML content.  Applications can
obtain the list of logged errors using SBMLDocument::getErrorLog() and
then use the methods provided by SBMLErrorLog to access individual
SBMLError objects.  (Note that despite the word "error" in the name,
SBMLError objects are used to represent not only "true" errors, but also
warnings and some informational diagnostics.  The name is a historical
hold-over from early versions of libSBML, in which the object really was
only used to report errors.)
Each SBMLError object instance has an identification number that
identifies the nature of the problem.  This "error id" number will be up
to five digits long, @if clike and it will be listed in one
of two enumerations: <a class="el" href="#SBMLErrorCode_t">
SBMLErrorCode_t</a> (described <a class="el" href="#SBMLErrorCode_t">
below</a>) or @link XMLError::XMLErrorCode_t XMLErrorCode_t @endlink
(described in the documentation for the class XMLError).  The former
enumeration contains all the SBML validation rule numbers listed in the
appendices of the SBML specification documents, as well as some
additional libSBML-specific error codes.@endif@if java and
it will come from one of two sets of static integer constants defined in
the interface class <code><a href="libsbmlConstants.html">
libsbmlConstants</a></code>: either the SBML error identifiers <a
class="el" href="#SBMLErrorCode_t"> (described below)</a> or the XML
error identifiers (described in the documentation for the class <code><a
href="XMLError.html"> XMLError</a></code>).  The former set of constants
includes all the SBML validation rule numbers listed in the appendices
of the SBML specification documents, as well as some additional
libSBML-specific error codes.@endif
Error codes are useful mainly for software.  For human readers,
SBMLError also includes text messages that describe the nature of a
given problem.  The messages can be accessed using
SBMLError::getShortMessage() and SBMLError::getMessage().  The former
provides a brief one-line description of the issue, while
SBMLError::getMessage() provides a more detailed text, including (if
appropriate) references to sections of the SBML specifications where
relevant topics are discussed.  These text strings are suitable for
displaying to human users.
An SBMLError object also contains a category code; its value may be
retrieved using the method SBMLError::getCategory().  Category values
are @if clike drawn from the enumeration <a class="el"
href="#SBMLErrorCategory_t">SBMLErrorCategory_t</a> described below.
Categories are used to partition errors into distinct conceptual groups.
This is principally used by the libSBML validation system to group
classes of validation checks.  For example, @c
LIBSBML_CAT_IDENTIFIER_CONSISTENCY is the category for tests that check
identifier consistency; C<LIBSBML_CAT_MATHML_CONSISTENCY> is the
category for MathML consistency checking; and so
on.  @endif@if java drawn from a set of static integer
constants defined in <code><a
href="libsbmlConstants.html">libsbmlConstants</a></code>, and having
names beginning with the characters C<LIBSBML_CAT_>.  The list
of possible codes is described in a separate section below.  Categories
are used to partition errors into distinct conceptual groups.  This is
principally used by the libSBML validation system to group classes of
validation checks.  For example, C<LIBSBML_CAT_IDENTIFIER_CONSISTENCY>
is the category for tests that check identifier consistency; @c
LIBSBML_CAT_MATHML_CONSISTENCY is the category for MathML consistency
checking; and so on. @endif
In addition, SBMLError also has a severity code.  Its value may be
retrieved using the method SBMLError::getSeverity().  The possible
severity values are the same as those reported by @if clike
XMLError.  Severity levels currently range from informational (@c
LIBSBML_SEV_INFO) to fatal errors (C<LIBSBML_SEV_FATAL>).  They can be
used by an application to evaluate how serious a given problem
is. @endif@if java <code><a
href="XMLError.html">XMLError</a></code>. Severity levels currently
range from informational (C<LIBSBML_SEV_INFO>) to fatal errors (@c
LIBSBML_SEV_FATAL).  They can be used by an application to evaluate how
serious a given problem is. @endif
Finally, SBMLError records the line and column near where the problem
occurred in the SBML content.  The values may be retrieved using the
methods SBMLError::getLine() and SBMLError::getColumn().  We say "near",
because a lot of factors affect how accurate the line/column information
ultimately is.  For example, different XML parsers have different
conventions for which line and column number they report for a
particular problem (which makes a difference when a problem involves an
opening XML tag on one line and a closing tag on another line).  In some
situations, some parsers report invalid line and/or column numbers
altogether.  If this occurs, libSBML sets the line and/or column number
in the SBMLError object to the the value of the maximum unsigned long
integer representable on the platform where libSBML is running.  (This
is equal to the constant named C<ULONG_MAX> in C and C++.)
The probability that a true line or column number in an SBML model would
equal this value is vanishingly small; thus, if an application
encounters these values in an XMLError object, it can assume no valid
line/column number could be provided by libSBML in that situation.
@if clike
<h3><a class="anchor" name="SBMLErrorCode_t">SBMLErrorCode_t</a></h3>
SBMLErrorCode_t is an enumeration of all SBML-level error, warning and
informational diagnostic codes.  Every SBMLError object has an error
code value that can be either a value from this enumeration, or a value
from the @link XMLError::XMLErrorCode_t XMLErrorCode_t @endlink
enumeration (see the documentation for XMLError).  The latter values
apply when the error or warning signifies a basic XML issue rather than
an SBML issue per se.  The values of SBMLErrorCode_t are distinguished
from those of @link XMLError::XMLErrorCode_t XMLErrorCode_t @endlink by
being numbered 10000 and higher, while the XML layer's codes are 9999 and
lower.  The method SBMLError::getErrorId() returns the error code of a
given SBMLError object instance.
The following is a table of the symbolic names of SBMLErrorCode_t values
and the meaning of each code.  In this table, the right-hand columns
titled "L1V1", "L1V2", etc. refer to Levels and Versions of the SBML
specifications, and the entries in each column refer to whether the
severity of the condition in that particular Level+Version of SBML.
The codes stand for the following:
@endif@if java <h3><a class="anchor" 
name="SBMLErrorCode_t">Error codes associated with SBMLError objects</a></h3>
The error and warning codes returned by libSBML are listed in the table
below.  The method SBMLError::getErrorId() returns the error code of a
given SBMLError object instance.  In the libSBML Java language
interface, these error identifiers are currently (in libSBML 3.3.x)
implemented as static integer constants defined in the interface class
<code><a href="libsbmlConstants.html">libsbmlConstants</a></code>.  This
is admittedly not an ideal approach from the standpoint of modern Java
programming, but it was necessary to work around the lack of
enumerations in Java prior to JDK 1.5.  Future versions of libSBML may
use a proper Java enumeration type to define the error identifiers.
In this table, the right-hand columns titled "L1V1", "L1V2", etc. refer
to Levels and Versions of the SBML specifications, and the entries in
each column refer to whether the severity of the condition in that
particular Level+Version of SBML.  The codes stand for the following:

<h3><a class="anchor" name="SBMLErrorCategory_t">SBMLErrorCategory_t</a></h3>
SBMLErrorCategory_t is an enumeration of category codes for SBMLError
diagnostics.  The category can be retrieved from an SBMLError object
using the method SBMLError::getCategory().  These enumeration values are
distinct from (and in addition to) the @link
XMLError::XMLErrorCategory_t XMLErrorCategory_t @endlink codes used by
the parent XMLError object.  User programs receiving an SBMLError object
can use this distinction to check whether the error represents a
low-level XML problem or an SBML problem.
The following table lists each possible value and a brief description of
its meaning.
@endif@if java <h3><a class="anchor"
name="SBMLErrorCategory_t">Category codes associated with SBMLError objects</a></h3>
As discussed above, each SBMLError object contains a value for a
category identifier, describing the type of issue that the SBMLError
object represents.  The category can be retrieved from an SBMLError
object using the method SBMLError::getCategory().  The following table

=item SBMLError::SBMLError

Creates a new SBMLError to report that something occurred during SBML
processing.

When a libSBML operation on SBML content results in a warning, error
or other diagnostic, the issue is reported as an SBMLError object.
SBMLError objects have identification numbers to indicate the nature
of the exception.  @if clike These numbers are drawn from
the enumeration <a class="el"
href="#SBMLErrorCode_t">
SBMLErrorCode_t</a>.  @endif@if java These numbers are
defined as unsigned integer constants in the file
"libsbmlConstants.html".  See the <a class="el"
href="#SBMLErrorCode_t">top of this documentation page</a> for a table
listing the possible values and their meanings. @endif The argument 
C<errorId> to this constructor I<can> be (but does not have to be) a
value from this @if clike enumeration. If it I<is> a value
from <a class="el" href="#SBMLErrorCode_t">SBMLErrorCode_t</a>, the
SBMLError class assumes the error is a low-level system or SBML layer
error and <em>prepends</em> a built-in, predefined error message to
any string passed in the argument C<details> to this constructor.  In
addition, all <a class="el"
href="#SBMLErrorCode_t">SBMLErrorCode_t</a> errors have associated
values for the C<severity> and C<category> codes, and these fields are
filled-in as well from the enumerations <a class="el"

href="#SBMLErrorCategory_t">SBMLErrorCategory_t</a>,
respectively. @endif@if java set of constants.  If it @em

assumes the error is a low-level system or SBML layer error and
<em>prepends</em> a built-in, predefined error message to any string
passed in the argument C<details> to this constructor.  In addition,
all the predefined error identifiers have associated values for the 
C<severity> and C<category> codes, and these fields are filled-in using
the libSBML defaults for each different error identifier. @endif
If the error identifier C<errorId> is a number greater than 99999, the
SBMLError class assumes the error was generated from another part of
the software and does not do additional filling in of values beyond
the default in the constructor itself.  This allows SBMLError to serve
as a base class for other errors, such as for user-defined validation
rules (see Validator).  Callers should fill in all the parameters with
suitable values if generating errors with codes greater than 99999 to
make maximum use of the SBMLError facilities.
@if clike As mentioned above, there are two other
enumerations, <a class="el"
href="#SBMLErrorSeverity_t">SBMLErrorSeverity_t</a> and <a class="el"

the severity and category of error for the predefined SBMLError codes.

assigned based on the error code.  If the value of C<errorId> is a
value from <a class="el" href="#SBMLErrorCode_t">SBMLErrorCode_t</a>,
callers do not need to fill in C<severity> and C<category>.
Conversely, if C<errorId> is not a value from <a class="el"
href="#SBMLErrorCode_t">SBMLErrorCode_t</a>, callers can use other
values (not just those from <a class="el"
href="#SBMLErrorSeverity_t">SBMLErrorSeverity_t</a> and <a class="el"
href="#SBMLErrorCategory_t">SBMLErrorCategory_t</a>, but their own
special values) for C<severity> and

there are additional constants defined for <a class="el"
href="#SBMLErrorSeverity_t">standard severity</a> and <a class="el"
href="#SBMLErrorCategory_t">standard category</a> codes, and every predefined 
error in libSBML has an associated value for severity and category taken
from these predefined sets.  These constants have symbol names
prefixed with C<LIBSBML_SEV_> and C<LIBSBML_CAT_>,
respectively.  If the value of C<errorId> is one of the standard error
codes, callers do not need to fill in C<severity> and C<category> in a
call to this constructor.  Conversely, if C<errorId> is not an existing
SBML-level error code, callers can use other values for C<severity> and
C<category>. @endif
Please see the top of the documentation for SBMLError for a longer
discussion of the possible error codes, their meanings, and their
applicability to different combinations of Level+Version of SBML.
@param errorId an unsigned int, the identification number of the error.
@param level the SBML Level of the SBML model
@param version the SBML Version within the Level of the SBML model
@param details a string containing additional details about the error.

=head2 CVTerm

Representation of MIRIAM-compliant controlled vocabulary annotation.
@htmlinclude not-sbml-warning.html
CVTerm is a libSBML construct used as part of the libSBML support for
annotations conforming to the guidelines specified by MIRIAM ("Minimum
Information Requested in the Annotation of biochemical Models").  The
general scheme is as follows.  A set of RDF-based annotations attached
to a given SBML C<&lt;annotation&gt;> element are read by
RDFAnnotationParser and converted into a list of CVTerm objects.  Each
CVTerm object instance stores the following components of an annotation:

=over

<li>The qualifier, which can be a MIRIAM "biological qualifier", a
"model qualifier", or an unknown qualifier (as far as the CVTerm class
is concerned).  Qualifiers are used in MIRIAM to indicate the nature of
the relationship between the object being annotated and the resource.
In CVTerm, the qualifiers can be manipulated using the methods
getQualifierType(), setQualifierType(), and related methods.
<li>The resource, represent by a URI (note: not a URL).  In CVTerm, the
resource component can be manipulated using the methods addResource()
and removeResource().

=item CVTerm::CVTerm

Creates a new CVTerm, optionally with the given #QualifierType_t value
C<type>.
The possible qualifier types are MODEL_QUALIFIER and
BIOLOGICAL_QUALIFIER.  If the given #QualifierType_t value is not
given, this method defaults to using UNKNOWN_QUALIFIER.  The
#QualifierType_t type value can be set using the setQualifierType()
method.

@param type a #QualifierType_t value
@if notcpp @docnote @htmlinclude warn-default-args-in-docs.html @endif


=item CVTerm::CVTerm

Create a new CVTerm from the given XMLNode.
RDFAnnotations within a model are stored as a list of CVTerms.  This allows
the user to interact with the CVTerms directly.  When LibSBML reads in a 
model containing RDFAnnotations it parses them into a list of CVTerms and
when writing a model it parses the CVTerms into the appropriate annotation
structure.  This function creates a CVTerm from the XMLNode supplied.

=head2 RDFAnnotationParser

Read/write/manipulate RDF annotations stored in SBML
annotation elements.
@htmlinclude not-sbml-warning.html
RDFAnnotationParser is a libSBML construct used as part of the libSBML
support for annotations conforming to the guidelines specified by MIRIAM
("Minimum Information Requested in the Annotation of biochemical
Models", <i>Nature Biotechnology</i>, vol. 23, no. 12, Dec. 2005).  Section 6
of the SBML Level&nbsp;2 Version&nbsp;4 specification defines a recommended way
of encoding MIRIAM information as RDF annotations in SBML.  The general
scheme is as follows.  A set of RDF-based annotations attached to a
given SBML C<&lt;annotation&gt;> element are read by
RDFAnnotationParser and converted into a list of CVTerm objects.  There
are different versions of the main method, @if clike RDFAnnotationParser::parseRDFAnnotation(const XMLNode  annotation, List  CVTerms) @endif
@if java RDFAnnotationParser::parseRDFAnnotation(const XMLNode  annotation, CVTermList  CVTerms) @endif
and RDFAnnotationParser::parseRDFAnnotation(const XMLNode  annotation), 
used depending on whether the annotation in question concerns the MIRIAM
model history or other MIRIAM resource annotations.  A special object
class, ModelHistory, is used to make it easier to manipulate model
history annotations.
All of the methods on RDFAnnotationParser are static; the class exists
only to encapsulate the annotation and CVTerm parsing and manipulation
functionality.


=over

=item RDFAnnotationParser::parseRDFAnnotation

Parses an annotation (given as an XMLNode tree) into a list of
CVTerms.

This is used to take an annotation that has been read into an SBML
model, identify the RDF elements within it, and create a list of
corresponding CVTerms.
@param annotation XMLNode containing the annotation.
@param CVTerms list of CVTerms to be created.
@see parseRDFAnnotation(const XMLNode  annotation)


=item RDFAnnotationParser::parseRDFAnnotation

Parses an annotation into a ModelHistory class instance.
This is used to take an annotation that has been read into an SBML
model, identify the RDF elements representing model history
information, and create a list of corresponding CVTerms.
@param annotation XMLNode containing the annotation.
Returns a pointer to the ModelHistory created.


=item RDFAnnotationParser::createAnnotation

Creates a blank annotation and returns the XMLNode corresonding to it.
The annotation created by this method is a completely empty SBML
C<&lt;annotation&gt;> element.  One use for this is to
then call createRDFAnnotation() to construct RDF content for this
empty annotation.
Returns a pointer to an XMLNode for the annotation
@see createRDFAnnotation()


=item RDFAnnotationParser::createRDFAnnotation

Creates blank RDF annotation content organized in the form defined in
Section 6 of the SBML Level 2 Version 4 specification .
The annotation created by this method has namespace declarations for
all the relevant XML namespaces used in RDF annotations and also has
an empty RDF element.  Note that this is not the containing
C<&lt;annotation&gt;> element; the method createAnnotation()
is available for that purpose.
Returns a pointer to an XMLNode


=item RDFAnnotationParser::deleteRDFAnnotation

Deletes any RDF annotation found in the given XMLNode tree and returns
any remaining annotation content.
The name of the given XMLNode must be "annotation", or else this
method returns NULL.
@param annotation the annotation tree within which the RDF annotation
is to be found and deleted
Returns the XMLNode structure with any RDF annotations deleted


=item RDFAnnotationParser::createRDFDescription

Takes an SBML object and creates an XMLNode corresponding to an
RDF "Description" element.
This method is a handy way of creating RDF description objects linked
by the appropriate "metaid" field, for insertion into RDF annotations
in a model.  (Note that this method does not create a complete
annotation; it only creates a description element.  For creating empty
RDF annotations that can serve as containers for RDF descriptions, see
createRDFAnnotation().

@param object the object to be annotated
Returns a new XMLNode containing the "rdf:about" structure for an
RDF "Description" element.
@see createRDFAnnotation()


=item RDFAnnotationParser::createCVTerms

Takes a list of CVTerms and creates a the RDF "Description" element.
This essentially takes the given SBML object, reads out the CVTerms
attached to it, calls createRDFDescriptiom() to create an RDF
"Description" element to hold the terms and adds each term with
appropriate qualifiers.
@param object the SBML object to start from
Returns the XMLNode tree corresponding to the Description element of
an RDF annotation.


=item RDFAnnotationParser::parseCVTerms

Takes a list of CVTerms and creates a complete SBML annotation
around it.
This essentially takes the given SBML object, calls createCVTerms
to read out the CVTerms
attached to it, calls createRDFAnnotation() to create an RDF
annotation to hold the terms, and finally calls createAnnotation() to
wrap the result as an SBML C<&lt;annotation&gt;> element.
@param object the SBML object to start from
Returns the XMLNode tree corresponding to the annotation.


=item RDFAnnotationParser::parseModelHistory

Takes an SBML object, reads off the model history information
stored in it, and creates a complete SBML annotation to store that
history.

@param object any SBase object
Returns the XMLNode corresponding to an annotation containing 
MIRIAM-compliant model history information in RDF format


=item RDFAnnotationParser::hasRDFAnnotation

Takes an SBML object, reads off the model history information
stored in it, and creates a complete SBML annotation to store that
history.

@param object any SBase object
Returns the XMLNode corresponding to an annotation containing 
MIRIAM-compliant model history information in RDF format
@deprecated libSBML internal


=item RDFAnnotationParser::hasAdditionalRDFAnnotation

Takes an SBML object, reads off the model history information
stored in it, and creates a complete SBML annotation to store that
history.

@param object any SBase object
Returns the XMLNode corresponding to an annotation containing 
MIRIAM-compliant model history information in RDF format
@deprecated libSBML internal


=item RDFAnnotationParser::hasCVTermRDFAnnotation

Takes an SBML object, reads off the model history information
stored in it, and creates a complete SBML annotation to store that
history.

@param object any SBase object
Returns the XMLNode corresponding to an annotation containing 
MIRIAM-compliant model history information in RDF format
@deprecated libSBML internal


=item RDFAnnotationParser::hasHistoryRDFAnnotation

Takes an SBML object, reads off the model history information

=head2 OStream

Wrapper class for the C++ standard streams C<cout>,
C<cerr>, and C<clog>.
A few libSBML methods accept an argument for indicating where to send
text string output.  An example is the SBMLDocument::printErrors(OStream
stream) method. However, the methods use C++ style streams and not Java
stream objects.  The OStream object exists to bridge the Java and
underlying native implementation.  It is a simple wrapper around the
underlying stream object and provides a few basic methods for
manipulating it.


=over

=back

=head2 OFStream

Wrapper class for the C++ standard file stream C<ofstream>.
The C++ C<ofstream> ("output file stream") provides an
interface for writing data to files as output streams.  This class,
OFStream, wraps the C++ C<ofstream> and provides an OStream
interface to it.  The file to be associated with the stream can be
specified as a parameter to the constructors in this class.
This class may be useful because some libSBML methods accept an argument
for indicating where to send text string output.  An example is the
SBMLDocument::printErrors(OStream stream) method.  The methods use C++ style streams
and not Java stream objects.  The OStream object exists to bridge the
Java and underlying native implementation.  It is a simple wrapper
around the underlying stream object and provides a few basic methods for
manipulating it.

=head2 OStringStream

Wrapper class for the C++ standard stream C<ostringstream>.
The C++ C<ostringstream> ("output string stream class")
provides an interface to manipulating strings as if they were output
streams.  This class class, OStringStream, wraps the
C<ostringstream> and provides an OStream interface to it.
This class may be useful because some libSBML methods accept an argument
for indicating where to send text string output.  An example is the 
SBMLDocument::printErrors(OStream stream) method.  The methods use
C++ style streams and not Java stream objects.  The OStream object
exists to bridge the Java and underlying native implementation.  It is a
simple wrapper around the underlying stream object and provides a few
basic methods for manipulating it.

instance that associates the file's content with an OStream object.
<p>
@param filename the name of the file to open
@param is_append whether to open the file for appending (default:
C<false>, meaning overwrite the content instead)
@if notcpp @docnote @htmlinclude warn-default-args-in-docs.html @endif


=item OFStream::open
