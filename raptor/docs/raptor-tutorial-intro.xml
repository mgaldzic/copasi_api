<title>Initialising and Finishing using the Library</title>

<para>Raptor has a single initialising function and a single
terminating function.  The initialising function must be called
before any other Raptor API functions are called:
<programlisting>
  raptor_init();
  ...
  raptor_finish();
</programlisting>
</para>

<para>It is safe to call these functions more than once.  But don't
do that!</para>
