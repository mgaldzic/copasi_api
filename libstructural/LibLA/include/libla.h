\brief		All definitions needed for the LibLA (Linear Algebra) library

\par 
The current scope of the library encompasses matrix factorizations (QR and LU 
factorization) as well as commonly needed matrix operations, such as calculating
the inverse of a matrix, computing eigen values and singular values as well as 
the null space of a matrix (both left and right null space) along with a method 
for the computation of the row echelon or Gauss Jordan form of a matrix.
